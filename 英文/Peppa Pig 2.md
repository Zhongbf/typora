# 2、Windy Autumn Day!

Today, Peppa is going to the park. It’s ==freezing== cold! It is cold! Quick! Let’s get our warm clothes on!

On cold days, Peppa and her family wear their hats and ==scarves== and coats. I’ll put the roof up.

Ooh, And let’s get the heating on. Everyone nice and warm? Yes, Daddy Pig!  Then let’s go! This is the park.

We’re here! Mummy, why are all the leave red and yellow? It’s ==Autumn== time, Peppa. 

In the Autumn, it gets a bit colder and the leaves change color. It’s quite windy. Let’s play a game to keep  warm.

My turn! Oh, it’s not meant to go that away. The sind is blowing the ball along! The ball is in the ==pond==.

Hmmm, I’ll just use this stick to ==reach== it. Just a bit further, Daddy. Be careful, Daddy Pig.

Don’t worry! I’ve almost got it. Daddy, is the water cold? A little bit. The wind has blown the ball out iof  the pond.

That’s lucky! Yes, what a stroke of luck! It’s getting even windier,  Hold onto your hats.Oh on! 

The wind has blown George’s hat off. Don’t worry George! Daddy Pig will catch your hat! Quick! Daddy!

Look! It’s in that little tree! Hmmm, I’ll just climb up and get it . 

The tree’s much too ==thin== to take your weight, Daddy Pig! So, how can we get George’s hat? 

Simple, I’ll give the tree a little ==shake==. Hmmm, Maybe if I shake it  a bit harder.

I tought that sort of thing only happened to me! It’s not funny. It’s a bit funny, Mummy. I suppose it is a bit funny.

Where’s George’s hat? It’s on your head! Here’s your hat George! Hold onto it this time! 

The wind is blowing all the leaves off the trees. Look at me! I’m living into the wind. 

The wind is strong enough to hold Peppa up! The wind is strong enough to hold George up.

Daddy! Have a do! Er. I’m a bit too heavy... Come on Daddy! It’s really fun! Oh, alright!

The wind is strong enough to hold up Daddy Pig! I say! This is fun! Come on , Mummy Pig! Give it a try!

But if the wind stops. I’ll fall over. The wind won’t just stop! The wind has stopped. it’s not funny. 

It’s a bit funny! Now, the wind has stopped. What can we do? What’s you favorite game?

Jumping up and down in muddy puddles. But there aren’t any puddles. Just lots boring, dry leaves.

And what do you do with dry leaves? I don’t know. Jump up and down in them! 

Daddy Pig loves jumping up and down in leaves. Peppa loves jumping and up in leaves.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in leaves. This is the best Autumn day ever!



# 3、Mysteries

Peppa and her family are watching  their favorite television program, Detective Potato. 

I am Detective Potato, the world famous detective. Please help me , Mr Detective. I can not find my flower anywhere.

Humm, you flower is on the top of your head. Oh, thank you, Mr. Detective.

That was easy. I can do that. I’m sure you could, Peppa. Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a famons detective.

George wants to be a detective, too.  If you’re going to be detective, you each need a hat.

Detecitve always wear hats. Now you look like two proper detectives. 

And we need one of those funny things that makes everything  look big? A ==magnifying== glass.

I think we’ve got one in the kitchen ==drawer==. Here they are. A real magnifying glass. Wow! How does it word?

You hold it in front of thins, and they look bigger. The magnifying glass makes the little fish look big.

Can I have a go? The magnifying glass makes George’s eyes look very big. 

Now what you detecitves need is a mystery to ==solve==. Daddy, what is a mysteries. A mystery is someing  detectives are good at ==sorting out==, like finding things that are lost. I know, we can find George‘s toy dinosaur.

That always getting lost. Mr. Dinosaur is not lost. What about your glasses, Daddy? You always losing them.

Now today, I’m wearing my glasses. It’s not fair. There aren’t any mysteries.

Would you like me to make you a mystery? Yes, please. Daddy Pig is going to make a mystery.

Now, what’s on the table? The little fish, teddy, a Jackin the box and Mr. Dinosaur. That’s right.

Now look very hard and try to remember them all. The little fish, Teedy, a Jackin the box and Mr. Dinosaur.

Have you remembered them? Yes, Ok! You just have to go outside for a moment. I’ll call you when I’m ready.

It sounds like daddy is going upstairs. And now he is coming down again. All right, you can come back inside now.

One thing is missing from the table. Do you know what? Mr. Dinosaur is there, little fish, Jack in the box.

So who’s missing? Teddy! That’s right. Teddy’s gone. Well done, Peppa and George. It was quite easy for us.

We’re famous detectives. Ah, but that’s only half the mystery. Where has teddy gone? Oh, I don’t know.

What are those little things on the floor? The cake crumbs. 

The magnifying glass makes the cake crunbs easy to see. I wonder if teddy has been eating cake.

And the crumbs ==lead== this wat. Teddy’s been eating a lot of cake. The crumbs lead into Peppa and George’s bedroom.

Oh, the crumbs have stopped. How could we find teddy? Ask me some questions.

But I would only answer yes or no. Ok humm, is teddy in this room? Yes. Is teddy in George’s bed? No.

Is teddy some where high up? Yes. Teddy’s in my bed. The mystery is solve.

Do you still want to be a detective when you grow up, Peppa? Being a detecitve is quite hard.

Next time I want to be the one who makes mysteries. Like you. Dear daddy.

Onec upon a time... Oh, sorry. Daddy Pig. Once upon a time there was a Red Monkey, and this Red Monkey had a bath.

And cleaned his teeth. He got into his bed. And soon he fell fast asleep. Good night, Red Monkey.

# 6、Traffic Jam

Granny Pig and Grandpa Pig are making lunch for Peppa and her family. I’ve ==dug== up some more potatoes.

Oh, Grandpa! We’re already got ==plenty== of potatoes. You can never have too many potatoes.

Ok, but get the potatoes in the ==oven==. The others will be here soon. Hoho, we’ve plenty of time.

It’s only eleven o’clock. Peppa and fer family are on the way. I wish we did ==set off== sooner.

We’re going to be late again. Don’t worry, Mummy Pig. We’ve still got lot of time. 

We’re always late when we go to Granny and Grandpa’s. Not this time. 

I’ve found a new way, that ==avoids== all the ==traffic== .Oh, I wasn’t ==expecting== that.  

Peppa and her family are stuck in a traffic Jam. Look, there’s Danny Dog and Granddad Dog.

Danny Dog and Granddad Dog are in the traffic jam, too. Hello Peppa. 

We’re going to my Granny and Grandpa’s for lunch. We’re going to be late. It’s one o’clock. They’re late as ==usual==.

How are your potatoes doing? Er. They still need a bit more cooking. Granny Pig speaking. Hello, Granny Pig.

We’re stuck in a traffic jam. Don’t worry, we’re running late, too. Grandpa’s gone over the top with potatoes.

See you in a bit. The poor dears are stuck in a traffic jam. Sounds like I’ve got time to get a few more potatoes.

Grandpa Pig! We’re moving so slowly. We’ll never get to Granny and Grandpa’s. Peppa’s right.

We have to try a different way. But there aren’ any other main roads. I know a ==shortcut==. 

Bye bye, everyone! We’re taking a shortcut. Bye bye Peppa. Good luck! 

Mummy Pig is taking a shortcut to get ahead of the traffic. The shortcut is very ==bumpy==. This is fun.

Are you sure about this? Trust me. Hello, ducks. We’re taking a shortcut. Look! There’s the main road again.

Well done. Mummy Pig. But we’ve still behind Danny’s ==lorry==. Hello, Welcome back! Oh,dear! 

Mummy Pig’s shortcut has not worked very well. Good! Lunch is ready. 

And most important of all: The potatoes are done! Lunch is ready. But Peppa and her family are still not here.

Grandpa Pig speaking. We almost at your house. But the traffic is still moving at the ==speed== of a snail.

A very, very slow snail. They’re almost here. But they’re still in the traffic jam.

Poor dears. The food is going to get cold. I’ve got an idea. I’ll get my ==wheelbarrow==. What is Grandpa Pig doing?

Granny Pig! Load the lunch into the wheelbarrow. Aye, aye, Grandpa Pig. 

If they can’t come to the lunch. We have to take the lunch to them. 

Look! There’s Granny and Grandpa with our lunch in a wheelbarrow. 

Ahoy, there! Lunch is ==served==. Is there enough for Danny and Granddad Dog to have some, too?

We’ve got enough for everyone. Good jod! You did lots and lots of potatoes, Grandpa.

You can never have too many potatoes.



# 7、Rock pools

Peppa and George are going to ==seaside== with Granny and Grandpa Pig. Peppa and George love the seaside.

Oh, where has the sand gone? There isn’t any sand down this beach, Peppa. 

No sand? But we wanted to make sand castles. Peppa and George love making sand castles.

No, no, George. Don’t be upset! There are lots of exciting things to do on this rocky beach. Like what?

When the sea goes out, it leaves little pools of water in amongst the rocks. That call rock pools.

And in these rock pools, there’s something special that the sea has left behind. I can see something ==glittering==.

It’s a coin. Maybe it’s a ==pirate’s== ==treasure==. Let’s make a ==collection==of all the things we find. 

Yes, we’ll put them in George’s bucket. What surprise is waiting i this pool? There’s nothing special in this one.

There’s always something, Peppa. Look, ==closer==! Whoa, there is something. Yes, it’s a crab!

The crab is ==pinching== Grandpa Pig’s ==finger== . Naughty, Mr. Crab. Look, George. Mr. Crab is walking side ways.

George is pretending to be a crab. Peppa wants to be a crab, too. We’re naughty crab. Pinch, pinch, pinch!

Help! There are two naughty crabs trying to pinch me. We’re naughty crabs. Pinch, pinch, pinch!

Shoo, shoo, shoo, you naughty crabs. Go back to your little rock pools.

Yes, let’s look in more rock pools. What can you see? A ==seashell==. Can you hear the sea in it?

What do you mean? If you put a shell to your ear, you could hear the sea. Wow, I can hear the sea!

I love my seashell. George, can you find a seashell, too? Shell! That’s not a shell. Peppa’s right. That’s not a shell.

George has found a ==fossil==. What’s a fossil? 

A fossil is the ==remains== of an animal that lived long ago when there were dinosaur.

Rock pools are such fun. Yes, they are fun for us. But not for this little fish. A fish. Where? Poor little fish. 

She’s ==trapped==. The little fish says she wants to go back to the sea. Maybe you could use your bucket to rescue her.

Yes, Peppa is rescuing the little fish in her bucket. Don’t worry. Mrs. Fish. You’ll soon be back with your friends.

I love rock pools!

What is Daddy Pig doing? To make a paper boat. Daddy Pig has made a paper boat. Thank you, Mr.Pig.

George wants a paper boat too. I suppose I can do that with sprots page. Please, can I have one? And me.

Of course. Daddy Pig’s making paper boats for everyone. Let’s have a race. Good idea, Mummy Pig.

We can huff, and puff, and blow the paper boats ==across==. Everyone takes a deep breath. Ready? Steady? Blow!

We have a winner. Who has this sports page? That’s Georges boat. George’s the winner.

I like boats, and I like paper boats the best. Me too! It’s time to go home.

Everybady has had a great time. Bye bye. Bye bye ducks. See you soon. 

The ducks enjoy the toy boats. but they quite like having the pood back to themselves again.

The little birds are looking for Grandpa Pig’s flower seeds. Look! The little birds are back.

Don't worry, Peppa. Mr. Scarecrow will scare them off.  It worked.

Mr. Scarecrow has scared the little birds away. Good! Now, my flower seeds will not be eaten.

Oh, Grandpa, the bird look very sad. Yes, thwy must be hungry. That’s why I’ve brought this.

What’s that, Granny? It’s birdfeeder. Grandpa, may I have some seeds, please? 

Come on, birdies! Lunchtime!  Now, the birds have their own seeds to eat.

George has jumped as far as he can. Now, it’s Richard Rabbit’s turn. If Richard doesn’t run, he won’t jump very far.

Richard Rabbit, Ready... Steady... Go. Richard Rabbit has jumped further than George.

And the winner is Richard Rabbit. George, remember, it’s not winning that matters, but taking part. 

The next race is the ==relay==. Each child needs to pick a parent to race. Peppa, pick me, pick me.

But Daddy, you’re not very good at running. I was very good when I was a little piggy.

But now you have a big tummy.  But I can still touch my toes nearly. All alright, Daddy. But you must run very fast.

The Mummies and Daddies will run the first part of the race. And then hand the ==batons== to the children.

Mummies and Daddies. Ready? Steady, Go! Run, Daddy. Mummy. Daddy Pig is in the lead. Come on, Daddy, Mummy.

Thank you, Daddy. You did very well. Peppa, stop talking and run. Keep running, go on.

And the winner is Emily Elephant. Oh, Daddy, I haven’t won a prize yet. Don’t worry, Peppa. 

There’s still one more event. And now for the last event of the day. The ==tug of war==. Boys are  against girl.

When I say go, you must pull the rope with all your ==strenght==. The girls will win. No they won’t. The boys will win.

Raddy! Steady! Go! Everyone is pulling so hard the rope is breaking. And the result is a draw. So both teams win.

I love the school sports day. ==Especially== when I win a prize.

Are they as lovely as mine, Dr, Elephant? Ah... Yes. George is very proud to have clean teeth.

Goerge, don’t forget the pink drink. Oh, wait, what’s this? What’s wrong, Dr. Elephant? 

George has clean teeth, but this young dinosaur’s teeth are very dirty.

The water jet please, Ms. Rabbit. The dentist uses water to clean Mr. Dinosaur’s teeth. The polisher, please, Ms. Rabbit.

This would be a bit noisy. Dr. Elephant polishes Mr. Dinosar’s teeth. Pink, pink..

Well done, mummy pig. it’s very tiny. How would all our toy fit inside? It’s a little small. 

Oh, George has found another bit. Oh, maybe that is a spare shelf. And these would be bits too.

Oh, dear, the cupboard is tiny, because mummy pig has not used all the pieces. 

We’ll just have to take it apart and start again. Oh, no. If only we have the instructions..

Who can that be? Hello, I just found these in my van. It’s the missing instructions. That would make things a lot easier.

The instructions look very complicated. It’s no good, it’s nonsense. Leave it to me, daddy pig.

I’m quite enjoy putting these things together. Really? Can we help it anyway? You can put the kettle on.

I’ll have a nice cup of tea with six sugars, please. Everyone is preparing tea and biscuits for Mr.Zebra.

Tea time, Mr.Zebra. Mr Zebra has built the toy cupboard. My goodness, that was quick. Yeah, and I’ve put all your toys in there too. Thank you, Mr. Zebra. But there is no room for these last two. Oh, poor teddy and Mr. Dinosaur.

Where are they going to live? Why not simply order another easy to make cupboard? No! I’ve got a better idea.

Teddy and Mr. Dinosaur can live on your beds. But mummy, that is where they lived before. Yes, I know.

That’s why it’s such a good idea.
