Pancakes! ==Delicious==! I love pancakes! Everyone loves pancakes! 

I’m the expert at flipping the pancakes over! Leave that to me! Are you sure, Daddy Pig? 

Last time. you got a bit grumpy when you dropped the pancake on the floor. （you were a bit grumpy，用过去式也可以，用got a bit 可以体现从不焦躁到焦躁的过程）

I did not get grumpy. There was a problem with the ==frying== pan.（什么东西有问题，用there be with sth）

Mummy, Can we help make the pancakes, please?

Yes, you can help me make the ==batter==. First, I put some ==flour== in the bowl. Now I add an egg. Now, the milk.

And I give it all a ==stir==. （可以用 then I stir it all.）

Mummy, can I stir? Yes, of course Peppa. Peppa loves stirring. Goerge wants to stir as well.

No, George, like this! Ok, that’s enough stirring. You two sit at the table while I cook the pancakes.

Mummy Pig is going to flip the pancake over! Hurray! You could flip it higher, Mummy Pig.

You can show us how, when you flip your own pancake, Daddy Pig. This first pancake is for George.

Mummy Pig ==pours== a little ==syrup== on George’s pancake. Delicious!  

This pancake is for Peppa. Hurray! Hmmm... you could flip it higher, Mummy Pig. 

You will get a change to show me when you flip you own pancake, Daddy Pig. Syrup, please!

Mmmmm! Delicious! This pancake is for Mummy Pig. Hurray! You still aren’t flipping them high enough, Mummy Pig.

The next pancake is yours, Daddy Pig. So now you can show us how it should be done. Mmmmm! Delicious!

Is everyone watching? The secret of making a good pancake is to flip it high into the air. One..Two..Three... hoopla!

Silly Daddy. Oh, maybe that was just a bit too high. what a ==shame==, that was the last pancake.

It should be a simple matter to get it down. Oh,dear!. Daddy pig cannot ==reach== his pancake.

Don’t worry, Daddy Pig, I think I know a way to get it down. Let’s go upstairs, chlidren.

This way. What is Mummy Pig planning to do? On the count of three, we all have to start jumping up and down.

One...Two...Three... jump. What are they doing? It worked! Now Daddy Pig has his pancake.

I wonder if we should check upstairs. Peppa, George! Are you awake? Well, I never, fast asleep.

So, it wasn’t Peppa and George making all that noise. I can’t hear anything. 

I think they really have fallen asleep. Let’s watch some television. Gradening! Today we are talking about “Roses”.

Oh. I love gardening ==programs==! The Gavesgate is a ==particularly== ==thorny== rose. 

To ==prune== it, start by ==lopping off== the head and then snip away the ==budding== shoots. 

Granny Pig. Peppa, George. You should be in bed asleep! George and I are not sleepy at all.

Can we watch TV with you? Well... I suppose watching a little TV might make you sleepy.

==Icelandic== Poses are a ==rare== ==treat== for the ==discerning horticulturist==.

But they are prone to lobbing in temperate habitats. This program is very boring.

Grandpa Pig Can you play that game? where you throw us up and carch us? Ok, but just one turn each!

George do you want a story? Say “yes”! Alright, I will tell you just one story!

If Daddy Pig tells you a story, you must both promise to go to sleep. We promise!

I think I’ll tell you the story of “The Sleepy Princess”. Is it a good story? It sounds a bit boring. It’s not boring.

It’s very good! Is there a little princess in it? Peppa, If you keep talking Daddy Pig can’t start the story!

Sorry, Mummy! Is there a little princess in the story, Daddy? Yes. there is a little princess in it.

She loved looking at herself in the ==mirror==. I am so pretty! Who else was living in the castle?

Er...Well.. The others in the castle were...the small Prince, Queen Mummy and King Daddy! That is right.

They were all living there as well. （as，too， also: 也）

Did King Daddy have a bug tummy? Of course not!

He was very handsome like me. Anyway, there was also a dragon! Dinosaur? A dinosaur? Oh, yes, it’s was’t a dragon.

It was a dinosaur! Living outside was a huge, ==fierce==, dinosaur. 

Maybe the dinosaur wasn’t quite that fiece, Daddy Pig? Sorry, George. No, the dinosaur was very ==gentle==.

It ate lots of grass. Daddy Pig. Sorry, I was being the dinosaur.

Why is the princess called “The Sleepy Princess”? I’m coming to that. You see, the sun set.

Then the stars and moon came out. And everyone got very sleepy. But the most sleepy of all was the Sleepy Princess!

Peppa, are you sleepy? No, Daddy. I am not sleepy at all. But some body is. George! Wake up! 

You’ll miss the end of the story! Well! Peppa might not be sleepy but the Sleepy Princess ==certainly==was.

Looking at herself all day in the mirror has completely worn her out. （wear ... out：让....筋疲力尽）

Let’s carry you to bed. Goodnight.

The Sleepy Princess was so sleepy. She had fallen fast asleep. Thank yor for that story, King Daddy! 

You’re welcome, Queen Mummy. And our little prince and princess enjoded it, too!

George take your boots off then you can visit Peppa in the tree house. Who is it? George?

Yes? Who is it? It’s Mummy Pig. Have you room for any more visitors? Hmmm! You have to say the secret words.

Then you can come into our house. I see. And what are the secret words? I have to whisper them to you.

The secret words are “Daddy’s Big Tummy!” I see! Say the secret words! “Daddy’s Big Tummy.”

 That’s right! “Daddy’s Big Tummy!” I think those are silly secret words.

Mummy, before you come in our house then must take you boots off . There’s room for Daddy, too!

Say th secret words, Daddy! Can I have different secret words, please? No!  Oh! all right. “Daddy’s Big Tummy.”

That’s right!  You can come in now, Daddy. Take your boots off!

I know! Daddy Pig can climb in through the top! Peppa, George Mummy Pig and Daddy Pig are all in the tree house!

Granny, I love our tree house! I don’t want to ever come out! （ever：时间线上的任何一点，任何时间）

That’s nice , Peppa.

But are you sure you don’t want to visit me in my house? No, thank you, Granny. 

In that case Grandpa Pig and I will just have to eat my homemade cookie all by ourselves.（in that case，既然这样）

Cookies! Granny Pig! Here are my home-made cookies! （Here：给东西别人的时候用，倒装句）

But, if you want to come in,  you have to say the secret words.

That’s easy. “Daddy’s Big Tummy!” That’s right! Well, I still think that  those are very silly secret words.

What’s next on the list, Peppa? ==Crisps==! Crisps are not on the list. We have ==plenty== of crisps at home, Peppa.

Have another guess. I just can’t remember. Can you remember Goerge. Dinosaur. 

George, there aren’t any dinosaur in the supermarket! No, George, The next thing on the list is onions.

I remember now! Here they are! Well done. One, two, three, four! onions. Very Good. 

That’s nearly everything on our list.  There’s one last thing on the list. A plant? Is that on the list?

Oh,on, George. That last thing on the list is fruit. Oh, Never mind, George. You can choose the fruit.

Where is the fruit? Over there! There are apples and oranges  and bananas and a very big ==melon==.

What fruit shall we have, George? Apples? Oranges? Bananas?  A melon.

This is the checkout where all the food is paid for. Tomatoes, spaghetti, onions, melon, chocolate cake...

Chocolate cake? Is that on the list? Peppa? Did you put the chocolate cake in the trolley. No, Mummy!

Goerge, Did you put the chocolate cake in the trolley? No. Well, I didn’t put it in. 

Then who did. I thought it might nice for ==pudding==. Daddy Pig. Naughty Daddy! 

Sorry, It just looked so delicious. It does look ==rather== yummy. Oh, let’s pretend it was on the list.

Thank you, Mr. Zebra. Goodbye! Look! I just got a parcel in the post! Can anyone guess what’s inside?

Dinosaur. Oh, George! You always say”dinosaur” for everything!  The parcel is far too small to have a dinosaur inside!

Hmmm... I think it’s a new toy! You’re very close. I know what it is! Your new ==camera==!

A new toy for Daddy Pig! That’s right! It’s a movie camera! 

We can make movies with it and watch them on our television! Can I use it first, Daddy?

Hmmm... It’s a bit harder than I thought... Suay Sheep’s mummy has a movie camera. She switches it on like this.

Oh. Well done, Peppa. Thank you for ==purchasing==. the moive 3000! I am ==eager== and ready to  shoot your first movie.
