# 1、莫妮卡的新室友

There‘s nothing to tell!  He's just some guy I work with!

Come on, you’re going out with the guy!
go out with：<俚> 约会

There’s gotta be something wrong with him.

So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

Wait, does he wat chalk?

Just, cause, I don’t want her to go through what I went through with Carl.

Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

It’s just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

Sounds like a date to me.

Alright, so I’m back in high school, I’m standing in the middle of the cafeteria and I realize I am totally naked.

Oh, yeah. Had that dream. 

Then I look down, and I realize there’s a phone... ...there.

Instead of...? That’s right.

Never had that dream. No.

All of a sudden, the phone start to ring. And it turns out it’s my mother, which is very-very weird because she never calls me!

Hi. 

This guy says “hello,” I wanna kill myself.

Are you okay, sweetie? 

I just feel like someone reached down my throat grabbed my samll intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... 

Cookie?

Carol moved her stuff out today

Let me get you some coffee. Thanks.

No, no don’t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I’ll be fine. allright?

Really, everyone. I hope she’ll be very happy.

No, you don’t. 

No I don’t., to hell with her, she left me! 
注释：to hell with （口）让....见鬼去，去他得

And you never knew she was a lesbian.

No! Okay?

Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

She didn’t know. How should I know?

Sometime I wish I was a lesbian. Did I that out loud?

Alright Ross, look. You’re feeling a lot of pain right now. You’re angry. You’re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? 	

Strip joints! Come, you’re single! have some hormones!

I don’t want to be single, okay? I just... I just wanna be married again!

And I just want a million dollars!

Rachel?

Oh, God, Monica, hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren’t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might the here and you are, you are!

Can I get you some offee? Decaff.

 Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another LincoIn High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother, Ross?

Hi, sure! Hi

So you wanna tell us now or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Oh, God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat. 

When all of a sudden... Sweet ‘N Low?
Sweet ‘N Low 代糖品牌，英文中可以直接用Sweet ’N Low 表示代糖

 I realized...

...that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! 
turn on：①打开... ②让某人更兴奋 or 引起人得性兴奋

And then I got really freaked out, and that’s when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. You know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but.. Anyway, I just had to get out of here, and I started wondering “Why an I doing this, and who am I doing this for?” So anyway I just didn’t know where to go, And I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you’re the only person I knew who lived here in the city.

Who wasn’t invited to the wedding.

Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn’t be an issue...

Now I’m guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she’s really not happy about it.

Daddy, I just... I can’t marry him!  I’m sorry. I just don’t love him. Well, it matters to me! 

Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. 

I say push her down the staits.

Push her down the stairs! Push her down the strairs! Push her down the stairs!

Come Daddy, listen to me! It’s like, it’s like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, “You’re a shoe! You’re a shoe, you’re a shoe, you’re a shoe!” And today I just stopped and I said, “What if don’t wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a-a purse , you know? Or a hat!” No, I’m not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I’m saying I am ha.. It’s a metaphor, Daddy! 

You can see where he’d have trouble.

Look Daddy, it’s my life. Well maybe I’ll just stay here with Monica.

Well, I guess we’re established who’s staying here with Monica...

Well, maybe that’s my decision. Well, maybe I don’t need your money.  Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!

Just breathe, breathe... that’s it. Just try to think of nice calm things...

Rain drops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens... 

La la la something with string. These are a few...

I’m all better now.

I helped!

Okay, look this is probably for the best, you know, Independence. Taking control of your life.

And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he’s away a lot.

Joey, stop hitting on her! It’s her wedding day! 
hitting on：勾引，调戏

What, like there’s a rule or something?

Please don’t do that again, it’s a horrible sound.

It’s Paul.

let him in.

Who’s Paul? Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

Wait a minunte. Your “not a real date” tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? 

He finally asked you out? - Yes!

Ooh, this is a “Dear Diary” moment.

Rach, wait, I can cancel...

Please, no, go, that’d be fine!

Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

That’d be good...

Ready? - No, go on! It’s Paul the Wine Guy!

Hi, come in! Paul, this is... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.

Hey! Paul! Hello. Hi! The Wine Guy!

I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name. Paul, was it?

Okay, sit down. Two seconds.

Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can’t be good.

So Rachel, what’re you, uh... what’re you up to tonight?

Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!

Right, you’re not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your big lizards...

 Anyway, if you don’t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
put together：组装

Yes, and we’re very excited about it.

Well actually thanks,  but I think I’m just gonna hang out here tonight. It’s been kinda a long day.
hang out：闲逛；消磨时间

Okay, sure.

Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help.

Oh, I wish I could, but I don’t want to.

I’m sopposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things....

...using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.

What’s this?

I have no idea.

Does with the bookcase!  - All finished!

This was Carol’s favorite beer. She alway drank it out of the can, I should have known.

Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV - What did you get?

You guy.

Oh, my God. You got screwed. 
you got screwed 表示你受骗了，你被耍了

Oh my God!

I know, I know, I’m such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother’s going through that right now, he’s such a mess. 

How did you get through it.
get through：克服

Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her... -leg?

That’s one way! Me, I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch?

Barry, I’m sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn’t, it’s about me, and I just... Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look,

You know what the scariest part is? What if there’s only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean what if you get one woman and that’s it?

Unfortunately， in my case, there was only one woman for her.

What are you talking about? “One woman?” That’s like saying there’s only one flavor of ice cream for you. 
Lemme tell you something, Ross. There’s lots of flavors out there. 
There’s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing Cherry Vanilla. 
You could get them with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! 
This is the best thing that ever happened to you! 
You got married, you were like, what, wight. 
Welcome back to the world! Grad a spoon! 

I honestly don’t know if I’m hungry or horny. 

Stay out of my freezer!

Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..

What?... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?

No, it’s, it’s more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

Isn’t there?

Yean... yean, I think there is.

What were you gonna say?

Well, Er, uh... ever since she left me, um, I haven’t been able to , uh, perform.. Sexually.

Oh, God, Oh, God, I am sorry... I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. 
Um... how long?

Two years. 

Wow! I’m glad you smashed her watch!

So yo still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

Yeah. Yeah, I do.

Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That’s the difference!

Grad a spoon.

Do you know how long it’s been since I’ve grabbed a spoon? 
Do the words “Billy, don’t be a hero” mean anything to you? You know, here’s the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to ask a woman out, who am I gonna ask?

Isn’t this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.

That is amazing. 

Congratulations. While you’re on a roll if you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something. 
Although actually I’m really not that hungry...

Morning.

Good morning

Morning.

Morning Paul.

Hello, Paul. Hi, Paul, is it?

Thank you, Thank you so much.

We’ll talk later.

Than wasn’t a real date? What the hell do you do on a real date?

Shut up, and put my table back.

Ok.

Allright, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don’t input those number...it doesn’t make much of a difference...

So, like, you guys ass have jobs?

Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that’s how we buy stuff.

Yeah, I’m an actor.

Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?

I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

Oh, wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the  Reruns production of Pinocchio.

“Look, Gippetto, I’m a real live boy.”

I will not take this abuse.

You’re right, I’m sorry.

“Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...”

So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can’t stop smiling. 

I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

I know, he’s just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony Demarco? 

Oh, yeah.

Well, it’s like that. With feelings.

Wow, are you in trouble!

Okay, Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I’m just gonna get up and go to work.

Oh, look, wish me luck!

What for?

I’m gonna go get one of those job things.

Hey, Monical! How was Florida?

You had sex, didn’t you?

How do you do that?

So? Who?

You know Paul?

Oh yeah, I know Paul.

You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

Are you kidding? I  take credit for Paul. You know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line!

Why? Why? WHy, why would anybody do something like that?

I assume we’re looking for an answer more sophisticated than “to get you into bed”.

Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

All right, come here, Give me your feet.

I just thought he was nice, you know?

I can’t believe you didn’t know it was a line!

Guess what?

You got a job?

Are you kidding? I’m trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

And yet you’re surprisingly upbeat.

You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale fifty percent off!.

Oh, how well you know me... 

They’re my new “I don’t need a job, I don’t need my parents, I’ve got great boots” boots!

How’d you pay for them? 

Uh, credit card.

And who pays for that?

Um... my... father.

Come on, you can’t live off your parents your whole life.

I know that. That’ why I was getting married.

Give her a break, it’s hard being on your own for the first time.

Thank, you.

You’re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. 
My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn’t know anybody. 
And I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields ...outside Port Authority and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

The word you’re looking for is “Anyway...”

All right, you ready?

I don’t think so.

Come on, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...

Welcome to real world! It sucks. You’re gonna love it!

Well, that’s it. You gonna crash on the couch?

No. No, I gotta go home sometime.

You be okay?

Yeah.

Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?

That’s Paul’s watch.

You just put it back where you found it. Oh, boy. Goodnight, everybody. Goodnight.

Sorry, no, no, no. No, you have it, ready, I don’t want it.

Split it?

Oaky.

You know, you probably didn’t know this,  but back in high schook, I had major crush on you.
[have a crush on sb :   迷恋某人，暗恋某人]

I knew.

You did. Oh.. I always figured you just thought I was Monica’s geeky older brother.

I did.

Oh. Listen, do you think any try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here. but do you think it would be okay if asked you out? Sometime, Maybe?

Yeah, maybe.

Okay... okay, maybe I will...

Goodnight.

Goodnight.

Wait,wait, what’s the deal?

I just grabbed a spoon.

I can’t believe what I’m hearing here.

I can’t believe what I’m hearing here...

What? I said you had a..

What I said you had...

Would you stop?

Oh, was I doing it again?

Yes.

Would anybody like more coffee?

Did you make it, or are you just serving it?

I’m just serving it.

Yeah. Yeah, I’ll have a cup of coffee.

Kid. new dream. I’m in Las Vegas. I’m Liza Minelli



# 2

What you guy don’t understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

Yeah, right!...  serious?

OH, yeah!

Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

Absolutely.

Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know? 
I mean it’s like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Yeah, and-and it’s not that we don’t like the comedian, it’s that... that’s not why we bought the ticket.

The problem is, though, after the concert’s over  no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, you know?
I mean, we’re the car, we’re fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you’re gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

...Are we still talking about sex?



S01E02:The One with the Sonorgram at the End

No, it’s good, it is good, it’s just that doesn’t she seem a little angry?

Well, she hsa issues. 

Does she.

He’s out banding other women over the head with a club, while she sits at hime trying to  get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like, “Gee, that glacier’s getting kind of close.”

See? Speaking of issues, isn’t that you ex-wife? Me? No. Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

How about I’ll catch up with you in the Ice Age?

So. You look great. I hate that.

Sorry. thanks. You look good too.

Ah, well, in tere, anyone who... stands erect... 

So, what’s new? Still a ... - A lesbian? 

Well... You never know. How’s, um...? How’s the family?

Marty’s still totally paranoid. Oh, and...

Why are you here, Carol?

I’m pregnant. - Pregnant?

She didn’t leave in such a hurry after all.

Oh, I think this is the episode of Three’s Company where there’s some kind of misunderstanding.

--- Then I’ve already seem this one!

Are you through with that?

Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

Whose little ball of paper is this?

Oh, uh, that would be mine, See, I wrote a note to myself and then I realised I didn’t need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.

She’s already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you’ve already fluffed that pillow... but, it’s fine!

Look, I’m sorry, guys, I just don’t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.

Yes, and we all know how cruel a parert can be about the flatness of a child’s pillow.

Monica? Hi! Um, Monice, you’re scaring me. I mean, you’re like all chaotic and twirly. And  not in a good way.

Yeah, calm down. You don’t see Ross getting all chaotic and  twirly every time they come.

That’s because as far as my parents are concerned,  Poss can do no wrong. Y’see, he’s the Prince. Apparently they some big ceremony before I was born.

What? Ugly Naked Guy got a thigh-master.

Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

Yeah, it’s beautiful. 

Oh God, Oh God, Oh God....

No look, don’t touch that! 

Oh like I wasn’t dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 
Hi Barry! Remember me? I’m the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family! Oh God and now I’m gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

Easy Rach, we’ll find it. Won’t we! 

Oh! Yeah!

Alright, when do you have it on last?  Doy! Probably right before she lost it!

You don’t get a lot of “doy” these days...

I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... -Dinah?

Ohhhhh, don’t be mad... You didn’t. Oh, I am sorry...

I gave you one job! 

Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

Now, Monica, you know that’s not how you look for an enagement ring in a  lasagen...

I just... can’t do it.

Boys? We’re going in.

Wow. That is not a happy hi.

Carol’s pregnant.  

Ooh! I found it! 

What?

Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.

Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

Well now, how do you fit into this whole thing.

Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I’m not comfortable with it, I don’t have to be involved, basically it’s totally up to me.

# She is so great! I miss her.

What does the mean by “involved”?

I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Anyway, they want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

So what are you gonna do?

I have no idea.

No matter what I do though, I’m still gonna be a father.

Well, this is still ruined, right?

Oh, Martha Ludwin’s daughter is gonna call you.

Mmm! What’s that curry taste? Curry

I think they’re great! I really do.

Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn’t she?

THey all had a thing for him. Aw, Mon...

I’m sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or... I don’t know.

Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant.

No Mon, I don’t have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.

Well, they don’t have to know that...

Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

Yeah. Oh, we’re having spaghetti! That’s easy.

I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bring up the whole bady/lesbian thing. Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

What that Rachel did to her life... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.

I’m not gonna tell you what they spent on what wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!

Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...

What’s that supposed to mean?

Nothing! It’s an expression. No, it’s not.

Don’t listen to your mother. You’re independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...

Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are. I’m telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God “Our Little Harmonica” doesn’t seem to have that proplem.

So, Ross, what’s going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

Okay, Okay, Look, uh- I realies you guys have been wondering what exactly  happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here’s the deal.

And you knew about this?

Your folks are really that bad, huh?

Well, you know, these people are pros. They know what they’re doing, they take their time, they get the job done.

Boy, I know they say you can’t change you parents... boy, if you could--I’d want yours. Must pee.

You know, it’s even worse when you’re twins.  

You’re twins? -Yeah. We don’t speak. She’s like this high-powered, driven career type.

What does she do? She’s waitress.

All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.

Chandler, you’re an only child, right? You don’t have any of this. 

Well, no. although I did have an imaginary friend, who...my parents actually preferred.

The lights, please...

...How long was I in there?

I’m just cleaning up.

Do you... uh... do you need any help?

Uh...okay, sure! Thanks!

Anyway...um... So, you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 

Oh... a little, a lot. So, got any advice? You know, as someone who’s recently been dumped.

Well, you may  wanna steer clear of the word “dumped.” Chances are he’s gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, you know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it’ll be hard. Or, you know, hey! I’ll do down there, and I’ll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

Oh, you’ve got Carol tomorrow... When did it so complicated? Got me.

Remember when we were in high school together? Yeah.

I mean, didn’t you think you were just gonna meet someone fall in love and that’d be it?

Ross? Yes, yes! Oh! Man, I never thought I’d be here...

Me nither.

Sorry I’m late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur... thing ... anyway.

Ross, you remember Susan. How could I forget? Ross.

Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we’re just waiting for...? Dr. Oberman.

Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he - she.

She, of course, she- uh- familiar with our ... special situation?

Yes, and she’s very supportive. Okay, that’s great.

No, I’m- Oh. Thanks

Ross? That opens my cervix.

Barry? Come in. Are you sure?

Yeah! It’s fine, it’s fine. Robbie’s gonna be here for hours. So, how are you doing? 

I’m okay... you look great! Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein’s gagging. Be right there.

Be back a secons. I dumped him.

So, how’s this all gonna work? You know, with us? You know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? Gieve me a “for instance”. 

Well, I don’t know, okay, okay, 

Marlon, if it’s a boy, Minnie if it’s a girl. As in Mouse? As in my grand mother.

Still, you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. How about Julia?

We agreed on Minnie. 

Totally, we agreed we’d spend the rest of lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia’s on the table...?

Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?

Oh, not much. I got a job. Oh, that’s great.

Why are you so tanned? I went to Aruba.

Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? No, I went with... Now, this may hurt.

I went with Mindy. Mindy? My maid of honour, Mindy?

Yeah, well, uh, we’re kind of a thing now.

Oh! Well...um, You’ve got plugs!

Careful! They haven’t quite taken yet. And you’ve got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!

Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I’ve ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I’m an orthodontist.

Wow. You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy, We weren’t happy. But with Mindy, now I’m happy. Spit. What? Me.

Anyway, um, guess this belongs to you. And thanks you for giving it to me. 

Well, thank you for giving it back. Hello.

Oh, please! What’s wrong with Helen? Helen Geller? I don’t think so.

It’s not gonna be Helen Geller. Thank you!

No, I mean it’s not Geller. 

What, it’s gonna be Helen Willick?

Ross. You’re not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? Cause I think that borders on child a abuse. 

Of course not,  I’m suggesting Geller-Willich-Bunch. 

Oh, no, nononon, you see what he’s doing? he knows no-one’s gonna say all those names, so they’ll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!

My way? You think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this not my way, you know what?

This is too hard. I’m not, I can’t do

Knock knock! How are we today? Any nausea? A little. Yeah. Yeah

Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be but thanks for sharing.

Uh, lie back.. 

You know what, I’m gonna go. I don’t think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.

Well? Isn’t that amazing? 

What are we supposed to be seeing here? I don’t know, but I think it’s about to attack the Enterprise.

You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kind looks like an old potato.

Then don’t do that, alright?

Monica. What do you think? Are you welling up? No

You are, you’re welling up. I’m not. You’re gonna be an aunt. Oh shot up.

Hi, Mindy. Hi, it’s Rachel. Yeah, I’m fine. I saw Barry today. Yeah, he told me. No, it’s okay. Radlly, it’s okay, I hope you two are very happy, I really  do. Oh, oh, and Mind, you know, if everything works out and you guys end up getting married and  having  kids and everything. I just hope they have his old hairline and you old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
