# Tonight on the Titanic

## Prologue

One day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books. Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morganis a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magie Tree House Books #5-8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In books #9-12 they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13-16, Jackand Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

Now, in book #17, they are about to begin a new set of adventures...



## 1：A New Mission

Jack opened his eyes.

It was a stormy night. The rain tapped hard on his window pane.

“Do you hear what the rain is saying?“ said a voice.

Jack turned on his lamp. 

Annie stood in his doorway. She wore her rain poncho over her pajamas and held a flashlight.

“It's saying, Come now!" she said.

“You're nuts," said Jack.

“Listen, just listen," said Annie.

Jack listened.

The rain did seem to be tapping out Come now! Come now!

“We have to go to the tree house," said Annie. "Something important is about to happen.”

“Now?” said Jack.

Jack didn't want to leave his warm, cozy room. But he had a feeling Annie was right. Something important was about to happen. 

“You coming?" she said.

“Yeah, yeah," he said. He climbed out of bed.

“Just put on your rain poncho,” said Annie.

Jack threw his rain poncho over pajamas. He pulled on his sneakers and grabbed his backpack.

“”Don't forget your Master Librarian card,” said Annie. “I have mine with me.” 

Jack put the card with the glowing letters ML on it into his backpack.

“I'm ready," he said.

Jack and Annie went quietly down the stairs. Then they slipped out the door into the chilly, damp night.

The storm had eased up. Rain fell gently as they ran up the street. The wet ground glistened in the beam of the flashlight.

They headed into the Frog Creek woods. Wind blew through the trees, shaking water to the ground.

Jack shivered. He wiped raindrops off his glasses.

“Brrr,” said Annie. "I'm cold.” 

“Me too,” said Jack.

As they kept walking, Annie pointed the flashlight up into the trees.

“There it is," she said. Her light had found the tree house.

“Morgant!" Jack called.

There was no answer.

“I wonder what's wrong,” said Annie. “I was sure she'd be here."

“Let's go up and see," said Jack.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack followed. Rain dripped from the trees onto his poncho.

They climbed into the tree house. Annie shined her light into each corner. The first three corners were empty.

Then the flashlight beam hit the fourth. Jack and Annie gasped with surprise.

Sitting in the corner was a small dog. He looked like a terrier puppy. He had scruffy light brown fur.

He stared sadly at Jack and Annie.

“Oh!” whispered Annie.

“Where did you come from?” said Jack.

Annie patted the dog's head. He wagged his tail.

"He's so cute” she said. “He looks like a little teddy bear. Hi, Teddy."

Teddy was actually a good name for him, Jack thought.

“Where did you come from, Teddy?” he asked.

The little dog whimpered.

“Don't be sad,” said Annie. “Everything's okay.”

“How did he get up here?” Jack asked.

“I don't know. But I bet Morgan had something to do with it," said Annie.

Jack's gaze fell on a piece of paper lying on the floor.

“I think you're right," he said.

He picked up the paper. On it was fancy writing that said:

​		This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

​						A gift from a ship lost at sea.

​						A gift from the prairie blue,

​						A gift from a forest far away.

​						A gift from a kangaroo.

​						Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.

​									Morgan

PS. Your Master Librarian cards won't help on this mission. Just be yourselves and all will be well.

“What kind of spell do you think Teddy is under?” said Annie.

“Who knows?” said Jack.

“Poor thing,” said Annie. She patted the dog's head. He licked her hand.

“It looks like we have to take four trips," said Jack.

Teddy trotted over to a book. He pushed it with his nose.

“Look!" said Annie. “I bet that will take us on the first trip."

She picked up the book that the little dog had chosen.

“Good job, Teddy," she said.

The title of the book was The Unsinkable Ship.

“Well, at least that's good," said Jack. “The ship won't sink, even if it is lost."

“Ready Teddy?” asked Annie.

“Arf! Arf!" he answered.

Jack pointed at the cover of the book.

I wish we could go there," he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## The Ursinkable Ship

“Arf! Arf!?”

Jack opened his eyes. He shivered. Wherever they were now, it was cold-very cold.

Teddy barked again.

“Shhh," said Jack.

Annie shined the flashlight on her clothes. 

“Wow, we're dressed like old-fashioned kids!" she said.

Instead of pajamas and a poncho, she worea sailor dress and a long wool cloak.

Jack had on an overcoat and knee-length pants with long socks. His backpack had turned to leather. He also had on a shirt and tie.

“Where are we?” he wondered aloud.

Jack and Annie looked out the window.

The moonless sky glittered with stars.

There was a soft wind and the sound of water lapping.

The tree house seemed to be resting on a wooden deck between two giant columns.

Jack looked up and saw smoke coming out of the columns.

“We must have landed on the ship between the smokestacks," he said.

Then Jack looked straight ahead and saw a box high in the air near the front of the ship.

“That must be the lookouts' nest" he said.

Jack sat back in the tree house and opened their book. Annie handed him the flashlight.

"Let's find out where we are," he said.

He turned to a picture of a huge ocean liner. By the light of the flashlight, he read:

​				Late at night, on April 14,1912, an English ocean liner was making her first vovage across the Atlantic 				Ocean.
​				She was going to New York City. Carrying 2,200 passengers, the ship was four city blocks long. 
​				Most people believed the ship was unsinkable.

“Oh, man, we're in 1912,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			April 141, 912

“This ship is huge,” said Annie. "How will we ever find the gift to help free Teddy?”

“You can't go looking for a gift," said Jack. “You have to wait until someone gives it to you.”

“Right," said Annie with a sigh. “Well. I guess we just have to be ourselves, like Morgan said. And maybe we'll get lucky.”

“This is hard," said Jack.

The little dog whined.

“Don't worry Teddy,” said Annie. "We’ll free you from your spell."

Just then, a shout came from the lookouts' nest:"Iceberg ahead!”

Jack and Annie turned back to the window——just in time to see a huge iceberg looming out of the sea.

The iceberg was dark with a fringe of white at the top. And it was right in front of the ship!

Jack felt a jolt. Then he heard a grinding sound. The ship was scraping against the mountain of ice.

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked.

“Shhh, don't be scared”, said Annie.

She picked the dog up and hugged him.

The scraping sound stopped. The ship slid past the iceberg until they lost sight of it.

The night was calm again.

“See?” Annie said to Teddy. "It was just a little bump. This ship is unsinkable."

But Jack was worried. “Wait. I have to read more about this," he said.

“Don't read now, Jack," said Annie. “It's time to get the gift. Come on, Teddy.”

She picked up the little dog and the flashlight. And she climbed out the tree house window.

“Hey-don't take the flashlight!” said Jack.

But Annie was gone.

“Annie!” called Jack.

He heard a soft “Yikes."

Annie stuck her head back in the tree house.

“Bad news," she said in a whisper. “I think you'd better see this."

Jack threw his stuff into his knapsack. He put it on and climbed out the window.

Annie was standing by the ship's railing, holding Teddy.

Without a word, she shined the flashlight on a life preserver hanging from the railing.

In big black letters were the words:

​			R.M.S. TITANIC



## 3：SOS

Jack stared at the name of the ship.

“You know what happened to the Titanic. don't you?" he said softly.

Annie nodded.

It hit an iceberg and sank," she said. “But I don't get it. I thought this ship was unsinkable."

“That's what people thought when the Titanic was built," said Jack. "But they were wrong.”

Suddenly, steam gushed out of the ship's smokestacks. Then the engines cut off. The Titanic stopped moving.

“We'd better go home," said Jack. "There's nothing we can do here. We'll have to find another lost ship——a safer one."

“No! We have to stay and help,” said Annie. “We can escape in the tree house anytime we want."

“But what can we do?” said Jack. "This ship's going to sink no matter what. We can't change history. And we can't take anyone into our time with us.”

”Yeah, but maybe there's some way we can help," said Annie.

“How?” said Jack.

I don't know” said Annie. "Let's look around.” Holding Teddy, she disappeared down a small stairway.

Jack followed her to a lower level.

Annie put Teddy down on the deck. The dog sniffed the chunks of ice that had fallen off the iceberg.

The ship seemed strangely empty.

“Where is everyone?” Annie asked.

“Maybe they're still asleep,” said Jack. They probably don't even know the ship hit something.”

Annie and Jack started toward the front of the Titanic.

“Come on, Teddy." said Annie.

The little dog scampered after them. They passed the round windows of different rooms on the ship. Jack looked through them as they went by.

He saw exercise bikes and rowing machines in one room. In another, there were palm trees, bamboo chairs, and tables. Next, they passed a library filled with books.

“This ship is like a town," said Jack.

Near the end of the deck, they peeked through another round window. Inside a little room, a man was wearing earphones.

Jack heard a clicking noise as the man tapped a lever on a black box.

“What's he doing?” whispered Annie.

Jack shrugged.

Another man stood nearby. He had a white beard and wore a fancy uniform.

"Send the international call for help," he ordered the man with headphones. "Tell all ships close by to come at once. We're sinking."

“Yes, Captain," said the man.

“Great, they're calling for help!” Annie whispered.

Jack shook his head. “I don't think help will come," he said.

He shined the flashlight on the book and found a picture of the radio operator.

He read quietly to Annie:

​			After the Titanic hit the iceberg at 11:40 P.M., the ship's radio operator sent out an SOS.
​			An SOS is the international distress signal in Morse code.
​			Unfortunately, the only ship near the Titanic had turned off its radio for the night.
​			All the other ships who received the message were too far away to help. 
​			When the Tianic sank around 2:20 A.M., she was all alone.

“That's terrible," said Annie.

“I wonder what time it is now,” said Jack.

“I don't know," said Annie.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			Sos Sent out 

​			Titanic Sinks at 2:20 AM.

“He's leaving," whispered Annie.

“Hide!” whispered Jack.

He and Annie moved quickly into the shadows.

The captain stepped out onto the deck. 

Tell the men to start loading the lifeboats now," the captain ordered a deck hand.

“Yes. Captain!" the man answered. 

The captain and the deck hand left. Annie turned to Jack.

“At least that's good,” she whispered. “Everyone can get into the lifeboats."

“I don't think it's good enough," said Jack. He read from the book again:

​			On the Titanic, there were 20 lifeboats. 
​			To save all the passengers the ship needed twice as many.
​			But with all the confusion on board, a number of the lifeboats were not even full when they left the ship. 
​			Many third-class passengers did not have a chance to get into any of the lifeboats because they were on 			the lower decks and didn't know where to go.

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​			Need twice as many lifeboats

"Hey. I know what we can do to help." said Annie.

“What?” asked Jack.

“We can help someone find the lifeboats," she said.

“You're right!” said Jack. “With our book. we can find our way to a lower deck."

He turned the page to a map of the ship. He and Annie studied it.

“We'll start at the grand stairway," said Jack. He traced a path with his finger. "Then we’ll go down to the third-class cabins this way”

“Good plan!” said Annie.

Jack looked back through the door. The radio operator was still tapping out his message——over and over and over.

“SOS,” whispered Jack.

He took a deep breath.

“Okay." he said. “Let's go."

## 4：Put on Your Life Belts!

Jack and Annie slipped through a door off the boat deck. Teddy was at their heels.

“Wow," breathed Annie.

“Arf! Arf!" Teddy barked.

They were at the top of the empty grand stairway. It was beautiful. It was made of dark, glossy wood. A huge dome with lights hung above it.

At the top of the stairs was a fancy clock.

The hands of the clock were at 12:20.

“Oh, man, it's twenty minutes after midnight!” said Jack. “The ship's going down in two hours!”

They hurried down the carpeted steps and into the first-class hallway. Teddy followed along.

Jack looked at the map in the book.

“These are the staterooms," he said. “This hall will take us to the third-class open deck."

“Hey, look," said Annie. "The floor's slanting down."

Jack caught his breath. She was right.

“That means the front of the ship is already sinking" he said.

Just then a man in a white uniform came down the hall.

He knocked on the doors.

“Put on your life belts at once and come up to the boat deck!” he called.

Men and women stumbled out of their rooms. They wore elegant robes made of shiny cloth and velvet.

“What's going on?” a woman asked.

“There's been a little accident," the man in the uniform said cheerfully.

“Oh, how silly," said the woman.

"It's not silly!” said Annie. “Do what he says!”

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked, as if he agreed with Annie.

"Shhh, Teddy!” said Jack.

He picked up the little dog. Then he and Annie hurried down the hall. They crossed the third-class open deck, where more people were standing.

These people were not dressed in fancy clothes. They mostly wore plain, dark coats. They didn't seem worried either. They were all joking and laughing.

Jack and Annie slipped through the crowd. They went into a big smoky room.

Four men were playing cards.

A woman played the piano. A young couple danced to the music.

“Put on your life belts and go up to the boat deck!” Annie shouted.

The people looked at Annie in surprise.

The card players smiled at her.

She opened her mouth to yell again, but Jack pulled her out the door.

“Come on," he said. "We have to get down to the third-class cabins before it's too late."

They hurried down another hall. Then they climbed down another stairway. Jack carried Teddy the whole way.

At the bottom of the stairs, they rounded a corner, and they both gasped.

The floor was really slanting down here, and water sloshed at the end of a hallway.

“The Titanic is sinking," said Jack.

“But no one understands!" said Annie.

“I know," said Jack, It made him feel terribly sad.

Teddy whined. Jack buried his face in the little dog's fur.

"Come on!" said Annie.

She began banging on the cabin doors.

The doors swung open. The cabins were all empty.

The people from this hallway must be the ones up near the lounge," said Jack. “Maybe we should go down to a lower deck."

He started to walk back to the stairs. But Teddy began barking furiously.

“What's wrong with him?” said Jack.

“I don't know," said Annie.

Suddenly, the dog leaped out of Jack's arms. He charged down the hall.

He was running straight toward the water!

“Wateh out!” cried Jack.

He and Annie ran after Teddy.

The dog began barking at a closed door.

The door opened.

A very small boy peeked out.



## 5：Williar and Lucy

The boy wore a nightshirt. He had red hair and freckles. He looked about four years old.

He rubbed his eyes sleepily. Then he saw Teddy.

“Puppy!" he said with a huge smile.

He threw his arms around the little dog's neck. Teddy licked his face.

“Come back to bed, William," a voice called from inside the room.

"Come out!” Annie shouted ."It's an emergency!”

A moment later, the door opened wider. A girl in a long white nightgown peeked out.

She had red hair and freckles, too. She was tall and thin. She looked to be about twelve or thirteen years old.

“Hello," she said. She put her arm around the little boy. “I'm Lucy O'Malley. This is my brother, William.”

“I'm Annie,” said Annie. “And this is my brother, Jack.”

“Get your parents and tell them to come with us," said Jack.

Lucy looked confused.

“Our parents aren't here. They're in New York," she said. “We're on our way to them."

"Listen, the Titanic has hit an iceberg,” said Annie. "We'll take you to a lifeboat."

“What do yon mean?" said Lucy.

“The ship's sinking," said Annie. "Look."

She pointed to the water at the end of the hall.

"Oh, not,” cried Lucy.

“Don't be afraid," said Jack. "Just get your coats and your life belts. We don't have much time."

Lucy nodded. Then she went back inside the room and came out with their things.

Lucy pulled on her coat and her life belt.

Annie helped William put his on.

“Let's go,” said Jack.

“Wait——can Teddy fit in your knapsack?” said Annie.

“Try," said Jack.

Annie slipped the little dog into the leather knapsack on Jack's back. Only Teddy sfront paws and head stuck out.
“Stay there, honey,” said Annie. She kissed Teddy on the nose.

Jack didn't feel any extra weight in his knapsack. The little dog felt as light as air.

“Wait——I forgot something," said Lucy.

“We don't have time——" started Jack.

But Lucy rushed back into the room.

“Hurry!” shouted Annie.

When Lucy came out, Jack saw her slip something into her coat pocket. Then she grabbed William's hand.

“Ready?” said Jack.

Suddenly, he felt freezing water brush against his shoes.

He looked down. The green sea water was slowly moving down the hall.

“Arf! Arf!” barked Teddy from Jack's pack.

“Run!” cried Annie.



## 6：Women and Children First

Annie led everyone down the hall to the stairs, away from the cold sea water.

As she and Lucy helped William up the stairs, Jack and Teddy followed.

Halfway up the staircase, Teddy let out a yelp.

Jack looked back.

The water was creeping up the stairs, step by step.

“Come on, Jack!" Annie shouted.

Jack ran up the rest of the stairs.

He and Annie led William and Lucy through the smoky room. The men were still playing cards.

“To the lifeboats!" Annie yelled at the card players. “Right now! Hurry!”

The men smiled at her again.

“Little girl," one said with a laugh, “even if this ship does sink, it will take all night. There's plenty of time for everyone on board to be rescued.”

“Indeed. Many ships are on their way right now," another man said in a soothing voice.“ There's nothing to worry about.”

“Not true!” said Annie.

Lucy turned to Jack.

“This doesn't sound so bad, after all," she said.

“It is bad. Please trust me,” said Jack. “We have to keep going.”

They went outside. The crowd on the third-class deck had grown.

Many wore life belts. But no one here seemed very worried yet.

Jack and Annie pulled Lucy and William along. They hurried through the crowd and down the first-class hall. They came to the end and trooped up the grand staircase.

On the top deck, the Titanic was as bright as a Christmas tree.

A band played lively music.

With a hiss and rush of light, a rocket streaked into the sky. It made a loud boom! Then it burst into many colored balls.

Shivering in the cold, William laughed and clapped.

“Fireworks!" he said.

Lucy smiled at Jack and Annie.

“This is a trick, isn't it?" she said. ”you've brought us to a party.”

“No. it isn't," said Jack. “Don't you remember the water downstairs?”

Lucy's smile faded.

“Women and children first!” someone shouted.

“That's you!” said Annie. "Come on!” 

She pulled Lucy and William toward a lifeboat.



## 7：The Gift

The lifeboat was waiting to go down. It looked tiny as it swung on cables at the side of the big ship. The water below looked black.

“Get in! Get in!" a uniformed man shouted.

”No, no” said William. He hid his face against Lucy's coat.

Lucy was shaking her head.

“I'd rather stay here," she said to Jack and Annie.

Jack understood. The brightly lit Titanic seemed so solid and safe compared to the little lifeboat.

“You can‘t stay here,” said Annie. "The Titanic is going to sink soon."

“Very soon,” said Jack.

Lucy kept shaking her head. Jack saw tears in her eyes.

“Lucy, we're telling the truth," said Jack. “You and William are in great danger."

”You have to be brave now," said Annie. “For your brother's sake,"

Lucy straightened up and tried to smile. 

“All right," she said. “I will.”

“This way!” a man called. “Women and children! This way, you four!”

He pointed at them.

“Get in,” said Jack. He gently pushed Lucy and William forward.

“Good-bye, Lucy,” said Annie. “Good-bye William."

Lucy looked surprised.

“You're not coming?" she asked.

“No, we're going home another way," said Annie.

“Oh, dear,” said Lucy. “I hope you'll be safe.”

“We will Don't worry!” said Jack.

“Wait.” said Lucy.

She reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a silver watch on a chain.

“This is a gift for both of you," she said. "It's our father's watch. We carried it on the voyage for good luck. I have a feeling that the two of you were our good luck tonight."

Jack looked at the watch as Lucy put it around Annie's neck.

The time on the watch was 1:50.

There were only thirty minutes left!

“Hurry, hurry!” he said.

Jack and Annie watched as a big man picked Lucy up and swung her into the little boat. Then he picked William up and put him in Lucy's lap.

“Bye!” cried Annie. She stepped forward to blow a kiss.

Just then, the man picked Annie up.

“No!” shouted Annie.

“Into the lifeboat, my dear!” the man said.

And he tossed Annie into the lifeboat.

“No! No!” cried Jack.

Then the man reached for him, too. Jack jumped away just in time.

"Annie!" he yelled. "Get out!”

Annie tried to climb out of the lifeboat.

“Iet me out!" she cried.

“Arf! Arf!” Teddy barked from over Jack's shoulder.

The lifeboat jerked. It started creaking down toward the dark, cold sea.

“Come back!" Jack called.

But there was nothing he could do as Annie disappeared from sight.



## 8：Every Man for Hiself

“Annie!” cried Jack.

“Let me out!" he heard Annie shout.

But the lifeboat kept going down.

“Wait for me!” came a loud voice. “Wait for me!”

A woman in a fur coat appeared at the railing. She nearly threw herself over the side of the ship.

“Stop!” the uniformed man called. “Bring the boat back up for Lady Blackwell!”

Slowly, the lifeboat was brought back up.

Jack pushed his way forward. The lifeboat came even with the ship. Jack reached out to Annie.

She grabbed his hands. He pulled her back onto the sinking ship.

"Room for one more!” Annie shouted to Lady Blackwell.

Then she and Jack took off before anyone could catch them.

They ran up the slanting deck. Annie stopped and peered over the railing.

Jack looked. too.

They saw Lucy and William's little lifeboat creaking down toward the Atlantie Ocean. It reached the glassy black water. Then it floated off into the darkness.

Annie waved.

“Bye, William! Bye, Lucy!” she shouted. “Thank you for your gift!”

She held up the watch that hung from her neck. Then she and Jack looked at it.

The time was 2:05.

“Only fifteen minutes left!" said Annie.

“We have to get back to the tree house now!" said Jack, "Let's climb the stairs to the smokestacks!”

Suddenly, the front of the ship dipped down into the sea. Deck chairs started to slide past Jack and Annie.

The band played a slow, calm song. It sounded like a church hymn.

But the crowd started to panic. People pushed and shouted, trying to get to a safer part of the ship.

“It's every man for himself!" the captain shouted to all of his crew.

The men all stopped what they were doingand ran up the deck.

Jack and Annie ran, too.

They dodged sliding tables and chairs.

They reached the stairs that led to the smokestacks.

They grabbed the railing and pulled themselves up the steps.

The ship tilted further.

“Get to those smokestacks!" cried Jack.

They slipped and crawled down the deck.

But when they got to the smokestacks, Jack and Annie looked around wildly.

The magic tree house was gone!



## 9：Time Stops

“Where is it?” shouted Annie.

The front of the Titanic sank deeper into the sea. Jack and Annie fell forward. 

They grabbed the railing and held on for their lives.

“Maybe the tree house fell into the ocean!” shouted Jack.

A great roar started coming from the ship.

Jack imagined everything crashing forward——all the furniture, dishes, bicycles, the grand clock on the staircase.
He looked down. A giant wave of water rolled over a lower deck.

Jack imagined water flooding the third-class corridor the card room, and the grand staircase.

He closed his eyes, waiting to be washed away.

“Arf! Arf!”

The barking came from a distance.

“Teddy!" cried Annie.

Jack had forgotten all about the little dog.

Holding on to the railing, he used one hand to pull off his knapsack.

Teddy wasn't there!

There was more frantic barking.

“Where's Teddy?" cried Jack.

“He's calling us!" shouted Annie.

“We can't look for him!” shouted Jack. “We'll fall off the ship!”

Teddy barked and barked.

“He's close by!" said Annie.

She held on to the railing and moved slowly down the steep deck.

“Annie!" cried Jack.

Suddenly the lights on the Titanic went out. The world was pitch-dark.

Jack couldn't see Annie at all.

“Annie!" he shouted.

He tried to move down the deck, too.

But the ship tilted again. Jack slipped and fell.

He rolled until he crashed into a smokestack.

“Jack!” cried Annie. “Here! Here!”

Teddy kept barking.

The back of the Titanic was rising out of the ocean, The front of the ship was going down.

Jack tried to go around the smokestack without falling.

In the dark, he could barely see the tree house. It was stuck between a smokestack and the railing. It was lying on its side.

Annie and Teddy were looking out the window.

“Teddy's barking led me here!” cried Annie. "Hurry, Jack!”

Jack crawled around the smokestack.

He held out his hand. Annie grabbed it.

She pulled him into the tree house.

Teddy licked his face.

“I wish we could go home!” shouted Annie, pointing at the Pennsylvania book.

Jack heard a loud CRA-A-A-ACK!

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：A Touch of Magic

“Oh, man," whispered Jack.

He was lying on the floor of the tree house. He was wearing his pajamas and rain poncho again.

“You okay?” Annie asked.

”Yeah. You?" said Jack.

“My heart's beating really fast," said Annie.

”Mine, too," said Jack.

He thought of the Titanic sinking into the cold black sea. His eyes filled with tears.

“It was terrible." he said.

Annie nodded. Jack could see tears on her cheeks.

Teddy licked Jack's face.

“Hey," said Jack. "How did you get out of my knapsack?”

Teddy whined. Jack and Annie stroked his furry head and ears.

“I think he has a touch of magic," said Annie.

Slowly. Jack sat up.

"He saved our lives," he said.

“And now we have the first gift to break the spell he's under," said Annie.

She turned on her flashlight. She shined it on the silver pocket watch that hung from her neck.

“Lucy's gift,” she said.

The watch had stopped. The hands were at 2:20.

Jack was silent. Then he sighed.

“That's exactly when the ship went down,” he said.

Annie looked at him.

“I guess that's when time stopped for the Titanic," she said.

Jack nodded.

Annie put the pocket watch on top of Morgan's note.

“A gift from a ship lost at sea," she said softly.

They were both quiet.

Then Jack took off his glasses and wiped the tears from his eyes.

Annie stood up. She took a deep breath.

“I'm ready to go," she said. “Let's put Teddy in your pack and take him home with us.”

She shined her flashlight around the tree house.

“Teddy?" she said.

There was no sign of the little dog.

“He's not here," said Annie.

“What are you talking about?” said Jack. “We were just petting him."

“He's up to his magic tricks again," said Annie. She sighed. "We'll have to go home without him."

“But what happened to him?” said Jack.

“I don't know,” said Annie. "But I have a feeling we'll see him again soon."

She started down the rope ladder. Jack looked around the tree house one last time.

“Teddy?" he said.

But the tree house was quiet.

Jack pulled on his backpack and climbed down the rope ladder.

Annie was waiting for him.

Without a word, Jack took her hand.

The rain had stopped. But water still dripped from the trees.

Stars glittered overhead in a clear sky.

Silently, Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods. They walked up the dark street to their house and climbed the steps to their porch.

Before. they went inside, they looked out again at the night.

“Time might have stopped for the Titanic,” Jack said. “But books and memories keep the Titanic alive, don't they? It's a true story, but it's also like a myth now."

"Yeah,” said Annie. “And every time the story's told, we wish it had a different ending."

Jack nodded. That was exactly how he felt.

Staring at the starry sky, he shuddered at the memory of the sinking ship.

He knew that he and Annie were lucky. They had come home.

“Good night, Titanic,” he said softly. “Good-bye."

Then he and Annie slipped quietly into their house, where it was cozy and dry and very safe.



## MORE FACTS FOR YOU ANDJACK

1)The Titanic hit the iceberg in the North Atlantic, approximately 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.

2)The Titanic was considered unsinkable because she was built with huge watertight doors to contain any possible leaks. However, when the ship hit the iceberg, six watertight compartments quickly filled up with water, dooming the ship.

3)The signal SOS was chosen as an international distress call because of the simplicity of the three letters in Morse code: three dots, three dashes, and three dots.

4)No one knows for certain exactly howlong the musicians played on the Titawic, but legend says they played until the ship went down, and their last song was the hymn "Nearer My God to Thee."

5)More than 1,500 people perished in the Titanic disaster, while 705 people escaped in lifeboats and were eventually rescued by a ship named the Carpathia.

6)After the sinking of the Titanic, laws were changed so that every ship was required to have enough lifeboats to carry all its passengers. Also, the International Ice Patrol was formed, so that ships would have warning about ice conditions.

7)In 1985, a scientist named Dr Robert Ballard discovered the undersea wreck of theTitanic.



# Buffalo Before Breakfast

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found it was filled with books. 

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to dowas point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5-8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. Inbooks #9-12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13-16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.
In Magic Tree House Books #17-20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free a mysterious dog from a magic spell. They have already received one gift on a trip to the Titanic. And now they are about to set out in search of the second gift...



## 1：Teddy's Back!

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Jack finished tying his sneakers. Then he looked out his bedroom window.

A small dog stood in the early sunlight. He had floppy ears and scruffy brown fur.

“Teddy!” said Jack.

Just then, Annie ran into Jack's room.

“Teddy's back!” she said. “It's time."

It was time for their second mission to help free the little dog from a spell.

Jack threw his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he followed Annie downstairs and past the kitchen.

“Where are you two going?” their mom called.

“Outside,” said Jack.

“Breakfast will be ready soon," she said. “And Grandmother will be here any minute.”

“We'll be right back," said Jack. He loved his grandmother's visits. She was kind and funny. And she always taught them new things.

Jack and Annie slipped out the front door.

Teddy was waiting for them.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Hey, where did you go last week?” Jack asked.

The small dog wagged his tail joyfully.

Then he ran up the sidewalk.

“Wait for us!” Annie shouted.

She and Jack followed Teddy up the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

They ran between the trees, Wind rattled the leaves. Birds swooped from branch to branch.

Teddy stopped at a rope ladder that hung from the tallest oak tree in the woods. At the top of the ladder was the magic tree house.

Jack and Annie stared up at it.

“No sign of Morgan," said Annie.

“Let's go up," said Jack.

Annie picked up Teddy. She carried him carefully up the ladder. Jack climbed after her.

Inside the tree house, Teddy sniffed a silver pocket watch on the floor. Beside it was the note that Morgan had written to Jack and Annie.

Annie picked up the note and read it aloud:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

​			A gift from a ship lost at sea,
​			A gift from the prairie blue,
​			A gift from a forest far away,
​			A gift from a kangaroo.
​			Be brave. Be wise. Be careful.

“We've got the first special thing,” said Annie, “the gift from a ship lost at sea.”

“Yeah," said Jack He picked up the silver pocket watch.

The time on the watch was 2:20——the time the Titanic had sunk.

Jack and Annie stared at the watch.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy's barking brought Jack back from his memories.

“Okay," Jack said. He sighed and pushed his glasses into place. “Now it's time for the gift from the prairie blue."

“What's that mean?" said Annie.

“I'm not sure,” said Jack. He looked around the tree house. “But I bet that book will take us there."

He picked up a book in the corner. The cover was a picture of a wide prairie. The title was The Great Plains.

“Ready?” Jack said.

Teddy yipped and wagged his tail.

“Let's go,” said Annie. “The sooner we free Teddy the better.”

Jack pointed at the cover.

“I wish we could go there," he said. 

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.




## 2：Ocean of Grass

Early sunlight slanted into the tree house. The cool breeze smelled of wild grass.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “These are neat clothes.”

Their jeans and T-shirts had magically changed. Jack had on a buckskin shirt and pants. Annie wore a fringed buckskin dress.

They both wore soft leather boots and coonskin caps. Jack's backpack was now a leather bag.

I feel like a mountain man," he said. 

“All you're missing is a mountain," said Annie. She pointed out the window.

Jack and Teddy looked out.

The tree house sat in a lone tree in a vast golden prairie. The sun was rising in the distance.

Wind whispered through the tall yellow grass. Shh-shh--shh, it said.

“We need a gift from the prairie blue," said Jack.

“I bet that means the sky," said Annie, looking up.

“Yep,” said Jack. The sky was growing bluer as they watched. "But how are we supposed to get it?”

“Just like last time," said Annie, "We have to wait till someone gives it to us."

“I don't see any sign of people out there,” said Jack.

He opened their book and read aloud.

​					The Great Plains are in the middle of the United States.
​					Before the 20th century, this vast prairie covered nearly a fifth of America's land. 
​					Some called it "an ocean of grass."

Jack pulled out his notebook.

“Come on," said Annie.

She picked up Teddy and carried him down the ladder.

Jack quickly wrote:

​			Great Plains——lots of land

“Wow. this is like an ocean of grass,” Annie called from below.

Jack slipped the Great Plains book and his notebook into his leather bag and climbed down.

When he stepped onto the ground, the grass came all the way up to his chest, It tickled his nose.

“Ah-ah-CHOO!” he sneezed.

“Let's go swimming in the grass ocean,” said Annie.

She started off with Teddy under her arm.

The wind blew gently as Jack hurried after her. All he could see was rolling waves of grass.

They walked and walked and walked.

Finally, they stopped to rest.

“We could walk for months and never see anything but grass" said Jack.

Arf! Arf!

“Teddy says there's something great up ahead,” said Annie.

“You can't tell what he's saying,” said Jack. “He's just barking."

“I can tell,” said Annie. "Trust me."

“We can't walk all day,” said Jack.

“Come on,” said Annie. “Just a little farther." She started walking again.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But he kept going through the tall, rippling grass. They went down a small slope, then up a small rise. At the top of the rise,Jack froze.

“Wow, that is great," he whispered.

“Told you," said Annie.



## 3：Black Hawk

Jack stared at a circle of tepees ahead. Busy people in buckskins moved about the circle. Horses and ponies grazed nearby.

Jack took out their research book and found a picture of the tepees.He read:

​			In the early 1800s, many different Native American tribes lived on the Great Plains. 
​			The Lakota were the  largest tribe. 
​			They lived mostly in the areas we now call North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			early 1800s——Lakota were 
​			largest tribe of Great Plains

Behind Jack and Annie, a horse neighed.

They  turned. A horse and rider were heading toward the tepee camp.

The sun was very bright behind the rider. Jack could only see the outline of a body with a bow and a quiver of arrows on his back.

Jack quickly flipped through the book. He found a picture of a man on horse back carrying a bow and arrows. Below the picture it said LAKOTA WARRIOR.

Jack read:

​			Everything changed for the Native Americans of the Great Plains after white settlers arrived in the mid-			1800s.
​			Fighting broke out between Lakota warriors and white soldiers. By the end of the 1800s, the Lakota 			were defeated. 
​			They lost both their land and their old way of life.

Jack looked back at the rider. The warrior was coming closer.

“Get down," he whispered.

“Why?” said Annie.

This might be a time when the Indians are fighting with the settlers," said Jack.

The grass rustled as the warrior passed by them. His horse neighed again.

Arf! Arf!

“Shh!” whispered Jack.

But it was too late. The warrior had heard Teddy's barking. He galloped toward them, grabbing his bow.

“Wait!” shouted Jack. He jumped up from the grass. “We come in peace!”

The rider halted.

Now Jack saw that he was only a boy on a pony. He couldn't have been more than ten or eleven.

“Hey, you're just a kid,” Annie said, smiling.

The boy didn't smile back. But he did lower his bow while he stared at Annie.

“What's your name?" she asked.

“Black Hawk," he said.

“Cool name,” said Annie. "We're Jack and Annie. We're just visiting. We live in Frog Creek Pennsylvania."

Black Hawk nodded. Then he turned his pony around and started toward the Lakota camp.

“Hey, can we come with you?” called Annie.

Black Hawk looked back.

“Yes," he said. “Meet my people."

“You mean your parents?" asked Annie.

“No, they died long ago,” said Black Hawk. “I live with my grandmother.”

"Oh, I'd like to meet your grandmother,” said Annie. “I'm going to see my grandmother today, too."

Black Hawk nudged his pony forward again. Annie followed with Teddy. 

Jack didn't move.

What if the Lakota are at war with the white settlers? he worried. What if they think we’re enemies?

“Annie!” Jack called softly. "We don't know if it's safe or not!”

But Annie just waved for him to come on.

Jack sighed. He opened the research book and quickly flipped through the pages. He wanted information about how to act with the Lakota.

On one page, he read:

​			Good manners to the Lakota mean speaking as few words as possible and sharing gifts when visiting.

On another page, he read:

​			The Lakota admire those who do not show fear.

Jack's favorite piece of information was:

​			Holding up two fingers means "friend."

Jack put the book away. He ran to catch up with Annie.

Annie was telling Black Hawk all about their grandmother. The boy listened silently.

“Annie," Jack whispered. “I just read that it's good manners to be quiet. And we should give gifts and not show fear. Also, holding up two fingers means ‘friend’.”

Annie nodded.

"Got that?” said Jack.

“Sure,” she said. “No talking, no fear, no problem.”

Jack looked up. He caught his breath.

Ahead of them, the people at the campsite had stopped what they were doing. All eyes were turned to Jack and Annie.

Jack quickly held up two fingers. Anniedid the same.



## 4：Good Manners

Black Hawk led Jack and Annie toward the tepees. Everyone kept watching them.

Jack couldn't tell what anyone was thinking. No one looked angry. But no one looked happy, either.

Jack wondered how to appear brave.

He glanced at Annie. She walked tall and straight. Her chin was up. Her face was calm.

Jack straightened his shoulders. He lifted his chin, and he felt braver.

Black Hawk stopped and slid off his pony. The pony headed for the grazing pasture.

Then Black Hawk led them to a tepee. It was covered with buffalo designs.

"Grandmother is inside," Black Hawk said to Jack and Annie.

Inside, the tepee looked like a small round room. A fire burned in the center. Smoke rose through a hole at the top.

An old woman sat on animal skins. She was sewing beads onto a moccasin.

She looked up at Jack and Annie. 

“Grandmother,” said Black Hawk. “This is Jack and Annie from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania."

Jack and Annie both held up two fingers for "friend."

Grandmother raised two fingers also.

Then Jack took off his coonskin cap. He gave it to Grandmother.

She put the cap on her head, then laughed. Jack and Annie laughed, too.

Grandmother's laughter and kind face reminded Jack of his own grandmother.

“You wish to learn our ways," she said.

Jack and Annie nodded. Jack could tell she was wise.

Grandmother stood and left the tepee.

They followed her.

Outside, everyone was busy again. They all seemed to know that Jack and Annie weren't enemies.

Jack looked around the camp.

Men and boys carved bows. Women and girls pounded meat and sewed clothes. One girl was adding claws to a buckskin shirt.

“The bear claws will give her the strength of the bear" said Grandmother. “She will sew on hawk feathers, elk teeth, and porcupine quills, too. All will give her the power of the animals.”

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			Sew bear claws to shirt

“I have strong animal power when I go on a buffalo hunt,” Black Hawk said proudly.

“What do you mean?" asked Jack. 

“I will show you,” said Black Hawk. “Wait."

Black Hawk went back inside the tepee.

Annie turned to Grandmother.

“Why does he hunt the buffalo?” she asked.

“The buffalo gives our people many gifts," said the old woman. “Food from his body. Tepees from his skin, tools from his bones." Jack started making a list.

“Cups from his horns,” Grandmother went on. “Ropes from his hair. Even winter sleds from his ribs.”

Jack finished his list.

​			buffalo
​			skin——tepee
​			bones——tools
​			horns——Cups
​			hair——ropes
​			ribs——Sleds

That reminds me of the seal hunter in the Arctic” said Annie. “He used all the gifts from the seal's body. He didn't waste a thing."

Just then, Teddy began growling and barking.

Jack and Annie turned around. They both gasped.
Coming out of Grandmother's tepee was a huge wolf!



## 5：Sunlight and Midnight

The wolf had yellow eyes and sharp teeth.

Teddy snarled and barked. Annie rushed forward to grab the little dog.

Suddenly the wolf stood up on its hindlegs!

“Yikes!" said Annie.

She leaped back.

Then she and Jack started to laugh.

The fierce wolf was Black Hawk wearing a wolf's hide! His head came out through a slit near the wolf's neck. He gave Jack and Anniea little smile.

“That's a great wolf suit," said Annie.

“Why do you wear that?” asked Jack.

“The wolf is the most powerful hunter of the buffalo," said Black Hawk. “When I wear his skin, I feel his strength."

“Wow,” said Annie.

Black Hawk looked at his grandmother.

“May I show them the buffalo now?” he said.

“Only show,” said Grandmother. “Do not hunt. We have enough meat today."

She looked back at Jack and Annie.

“Lakota never take more buffalo than we need," she said.

“That's good,” said Annie.

Black Hawk handed his wolf skin to Grandmother. Then he ran to the grazing ponies.

He climbed on his. Then he herded two ponies, one black and one yellow, over to Jack and Annie.

“Hi, Midnight. Hi, Sunlight,” said Annie, naming the ponies. She patted their noses.

“Annie,” whispered Jack, “How are we going to ride without saddles or reins?”

“Just hold on to their manes," she said, “and grip with your legs. Watch.”

Annie threw her arms around Midnight's neck. She slung her leg over the pony's back and pulled herself up.

“I’ll carry Teddy in the bag,” Annie said. 

Jack picked up Teddy and slipped him inside the leather bag. He handed it to Annie who hung it over her shoulder. Teddy's head peeked out of the bag.

Arf! he barked.

“Giddy-up, Midnight!” said Annie. The pony started to walk away.

“Wait," said Jack.

He turned to Black Hawk. He had just a few questions.

Black Hawk let out a wild whoop and took oof, too.

Jack took a deep breath. He threw his arms around Sunlight's neck. Then he slung his leg over the pony's back.

The pony started to move!

“Wait——wait!” said Jack. He hopped on one foot, trying to keep up.

The pony stopped.

Slowly, Jack pulled himself onto Sunlight's back. He gripped the pony's mane. Then he carefully reached up and pushed his glasses into place.

He looked over his shoulder. Grandmother was watching.

She nodded at him.

Lakota people admire those who do not show fear, Jack remembered.

He liked Grandmother. He wanted her to admire him. He let out a wild whoop, and Sunlight took off like the wind.

The whoop made Jack feel braver.

He held tightly to Sunlight's mane. They caught up with Black Hawk and Annie, and together they all rode through the tall grass. 

Shadows of clouds swept over the plains. They looked like giant dark birds spreading their wings.

Black Hawk's pony stopped at the top of a grassy slope. Sunlight and Midnight halted right behind him.

Jack couldn't believe his eyes.

Before them were thousands and thousands of grazing buffalo.



## 6：Stampede!

“Wow,” whispered Jack and Annie together.

Black Hawk looked silently at the grazing buffalo.

“Hand me the research book," said Jack.

Annie lifted Teddy out of the bag. Then she slid the book out and gave it to Jack.

He found a picture of a buffalo herd. He read to himself.

​			The true name of the buffalo is “bison."
​			At the beginning of the 1800s, there  were 40 million bison on the Great Plains.
​			One hundred years later, there were less than 300. 
​			Almost all had been killed by white hunters and soldiers.

Jack looked back at the vast herd. As far as he could see, there was nothing but buffalo.

Now Jack knew for certain they'd come to the time before the white settlers and soldiers had arrived, before the end of the great buffalo herds.

”I have been on many hunts,” Black Hawk said, his eyes still on the buffalo.

“Were you scared?” said Jack.

Black Hawk shook his head.

“You're really brave," said Annie.

Black Hawk smiled proudly.

“I will show you how a brave hunter moves,” he said.

He slid off his pony.

“Wait, your grandmother said not to hunt," said Annie. “Plus, you don't have your wolf suit.”

“I am not afraid," said Black Hawk.

“I don't think you should go down there," said Jack. “There's no grownups around."

But Black Hawk wasn't listening.

He began creeping on all fours toward the buffalo.

"I have a feeling something bad is going to happen," said Annie.

Jack had the same feeling. He looked back at the book.

​			A bison can weigh two thousand pounds and stand six feet high.
​			If one becomes alarmed by a hunter, he might start running and set off a terrifying stampede.

Jack looked back at Black Hawk. He was creeping closer and closer to the herd.

Jack's heart pounded. He wanted to shout, Come back! But he didn't want to scare any of the huge, fierce-looking animals.

Keeping his eyes on Black Hawk, Jack handed the plains book to Annie. She slid it back into the bag beside Teddy.

Black Hawk stopped just as he was passing the nearest buffalo. His eyes squeezed shut. His nose wrinkled up. His mouth opened.

“What's he doing?" asked Jack.

“Ah-ah-CHOO!” Black Hawk sneezed.

“Uh-oh," said Annie.

The huge buffalo jerked its head up. It made a low, moaning sound. Then it pointed its horns and charged!

“Watch out!” cried Jack. Black Hawk threw himself out of the way of the charging buffalo.
A ripple went through the herd as other shaggy animals looked up.

Suddenly, Teddy jumped out of Annie's arms. He landed in the tall grass and ran toward the buffalo.

“Teddy!” shouted Annie.

The dog tore down the hill. He bounded along the edge of the herd, barking furiously.

“Teddy, come back!" cried Annie.

She slid off her pony and ran after Teddy.

Jack tried to see Black Hawk.

The boy was still dodging the running buffalo. He looked tired.

Jack took a deep breath.

“Go to Black Hawk!” he said, nudging Sunlight with his knees.

The golden pony charged down the slope.

He ran between the buffalo.

“Black Hawk!” Jack shouted.

Black Hawk started running toward Sunlight. The buffalo swerved behind him.

Sunlieht slowed as Black Hawk got near. The boy threw himself over the golden pony's back. He held on to Jack as Sunlight veered away from the buffalo and ran back up the slope.

“Where's Annie?” Jack cried as they reached the top.

“There!” said Black Hawk, pointing.

Annie was surrounded by buffalo——calm buffalo. She was patting them and talking to them. The buffalo near her had stopped running, too.

The ones beyond those started to calm down...then others...until all the buffalo had stopped running.They began grazing againas if nothing had happened.



## 7：White Buffalo Woman

“She has good medicine," said Black Hawk.

“Annie doesn't have any medicine,” Jack said. "She just has a way with animals."

Black Hawk was silent. He climbed back on his waiting pony. Then he rode down toward Annie.

Jack followed. Annie's pony trailed behind. 

Annie turned to Jack and Black Hawk as they rode up to her. On her face was a look of amazement.

“You wouldn't believe what happened!” she said.

“You stopped the stampede,” said Black Hawk.

“But it wasn't just me," said Annie.

“What do you mean?” asked Jack.

“I was trying to find Teddy," said Annie, “and I got in the way of the buffalo. I couldn't escape. So I held up my hands and shouted ‘Stop!' Then, out of nowhere, a beautiful lady in a white leather dress came to help me."

"You saw a lady in white?” asked Black Hawk His eyes had grown wide.

“Yes!" said Annie. “She held up her hands, and the buffalo stopped running. Then she disappeared."

“Where's Teddy?" said Jack.

Annie gasped.

“I don't know! I forgot about him!" she said. "Teddy! Teddy!"

Arf! Arf!

The little dog came bounding out of the grass toward them.

Annie scooped him up. Teddy licked her face all over.

“Where did you go?” Annie asked him. Did you see the beautiful lady, too?”

“That lady does not live on this earth," Black Hawk said softly.

“What do you mean?” said Annie.

“You saw the spirit of White Buffalo Woman,” he said.

“What do you mean, spirit?” said Jack. “You mean like a ghost?”

Black Hawk turned his pony around.

“Let us go back," he said. “We must tell Grandmother.”

Annie put Teddy in Jack's bag. Then she climbed on her pony, and they took off.

Behind them, the buffalo grazed peacefully on the plains.



## 8：Sacred Circle

The sun was going down as the three ponies galloped for home. The deep blue sky was streaked with golden red light.

Back at the Lakota camp, the circle of tepees glowed in the setting sun. People were gathered around a large fire.

Black Hawk led Jack and Annie to the camp. They got off their ponies and went over to the fire.

Grandmother rose to greet them.

“You have been gone a long time，” she said.

Black Hawk looked her bravely in the eye.

“Grandmother, I tried to hunt the buffalo alone," he said. “One charged at me, but Jack saved my life. Then Annie and White Buffalo Woman stopped all the other buffalo from astampede.”

“Let this be a lesson to you," Grandmother said sternly. "Your pride led you to show off. Showing off made you behave foolishly. Your foolishness frightened a buffalo. He frightened others. One thing always leads to another. Everything is related."

“I am sorry,” said Black Hawk. He hung his head. “I have learned." Jack felt sorry for Black Hawk.

“I make mistakes sometimes, too," he said softly.

“Me too,” said Annie.

Grandmother looked at Jack and Annie.

“Buffalo Girl and Rides-Like-Wind showed great courage today," she said.

Jack smiled. He loved his new Lakota name: Rides-Like-Wind.

“We welcome you to our family,” said Grandmother.

The evening shadows spread over the camp. Someone began beating a drum. It sounded like a heartbeat.

“Come, sit with us in our circle," said Grandmother.

They sat with her near the warm fire. Acool breeze blew sparks into the gray twilight.

An old man held a long pipe up to the sky. He pointed it to the east, the south, the west, and the north.

Then he passed the pipe to the next man in the circle. The man put the pipe to his lips and blew smoke into the golden firelight. Then he passed it on.

The smoke from the sacred pipe joins all things to the Great Spirit," Grandmother said to Jack and Annie.

“The Great Spirit?” asked Annie. 

“The Great Spirit is the source of all things in the sacred circle of life" said Grandmother. “It is the source of all spirits."

“What spirits?” asked Jack. 

“There are many,” said Grandmother. “Wind spirits, tree spirits, bird spirits. Sometimes they can be seen. Sometimes not.”

“What about the White Buffalo Woman?” said Jack, “Who is she?”

“She is a messenger of the Great Spirit," said Grandmother. “He sent her when the people were starving. She brought the sacred pipe so that our prayers could rise to the Great Spirit. He answers by sending us the buffalo."

“Why do you think White Buffalo Woman came to me?” asked Annie.

“Sometimes courage can summon help from the beyond," Grandmother said.

She pulled a brown-and-white feather from a small buckskin bag.

She put the feather on the ground in front of Jack and Annie.

“This is a gift for you,” she said. “An eagle's feather for your courage.”

Arf! Arf! Teddy wagged his tail.

Jack and Annie smiled at each other. The eagle's feather was  their “gift from the prairie blue.”

Their mission was complete.

The chanting and drumbeats grew louder and louder. Then they stopped.

The old man held the pipe up to the sky. 

“All things are related," he said.

The pipe-smoking ceremony was over.

The sky was dark and filled with stars.

One by one, people rose from the circle and went to their tepees.

Jack put the eagle's feather in his bag and yawned.

“We better go home now," he said.

“You must rest first," said Grandmother. “You can leave in the dawn."

“Good plan,” said Annie. She was yawning too.

They went with Grandmother and Black Hawk to their tepee.

Grandmother pointed to two buffalo robes that lay to one side of the still-burning fire. Jack and Annie stretched out on them. Teddy snuggled between them.

Grandmother and Black Hawk lay on robes across from them.

Jack watched as the bluish white smoke rose from the fire. It went up through the tepee hole and into the endless starry sky.

Jack listened to the wind blowing through the grass: Shh-shh--shh.

It's the voice of the Great Plains, he thought. Then he drifted off to sleep.





VolcePE

## 9：Lakota School

Jack felt Teddy licking his cheek.

He opened his eyes. Gray light came through the smoke hole.

The fire was out. The tepee was empty.

Jack jumped up. He grabbed his bag and hurried outside with Teddy.

In the cool light before dawn, everyone was taking down their tepees. They were loading them onto wooden platforms strapped to two poles. The poles were pulled by horses.

Grandmother and Black Hawk piled tools and clothes onto their platform.

Annie stuffed buffalo meat into a rawhide bag.

“What's happening?” Jack asked.

“It is time to follow the buffalo,” said Grandmother. “We will camp somewhere else for a few weeks."

Jack pulled out his notebook. He still had many questions. But he tried to choose just a few.

“Can you camp anywhere?” he asked. “Even when you don't own the land?”

Black Hawk laughed.

“People cannot own land," he said. “The land belongs to the Great Spirit.”

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​			land owned by Great Sprit, not people

“What about school?” said Jack. “Don't you have to go to school?”

“What is school?” Black Hawk said.

“It's a place where kids go to learn things," Jack explained.

Black Hawk laughed again.

“There is not only one place to learn," he said. “In camp we learn to make clothes, tools, and tepees. On the plains we learn to ride and hunt. We look at the sky and learn courage from the eagle."

Jack wrote:

​			Lakota school is everywhere

Grandmother turned to Jack and Annie.

“Will you walk with us toward the sunset?" she asked.

Jack shook his head.

“We have to go the other way," he said, “toward the sunrise.”

“Thank you for the eagle's feather,” said Annie.

“Let your thoughts rise as high as that feather,” said Grandmother. “It is good medicine.”

“What does that mean?” Jack asked. “Good medicine?”

“Good medicine connects you to the world of the spirits," she said.

Jack nodded. But he still didn't really understand.

“Good-bye, Buffalo Girl and Rides-Like-Wind.” said Grandmother. “We wish you a safe journey.”

Jack and Annie waved. Then they started walking back the way they'd come.

Teddy ran ahead of them. At the top of the rise, they looked back.

Grandmother, Black Hawk, and the rest of the tribe were watching.

Jack and Annie both held up two fingers for “friend.” Then they took off down the slope.

They ran across the prairie...through the tall, whispering grass...all the way back to the tree house.

Annie put Teddy in the leather bag. She and Jack climbed up the rope ladder.

They looked out the window one last time. The ocean of grass was golden in the early sunlight.

By now, the Lakota are walking west, Jack thought.

“Soon  everything will change,” he said sadly. “The buffalo will vanish. The old way of life for the Lakota will vanish, too."

“But the Great Spirit won't ever vanish." said Annie. “It will always take care of Black Hawk's people."

Jack smiled. Annie's words made him feel better.

Arf, arf! Teddy barked, as if to say Let's go!

“Okay, okay,” said Jack.

He picked up the Pennsylvania book and pointed at a picture of Frog Creek.

“I wish we could go home to our people,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Good Medicine

“We're home,” said Annie.

Bright sunlight flooded the tree house. Teddy licked Jack's and Annie's faces. They were back in their jeans and T-shirts.

“Hey, silly,” Annie said to the dog. “Now we have the second thing to help free you from your spell.”

She took the eagle's feather out of Jack's backpack. She put it on Morgan's note, next to the silver pocket watch from the Titanic.

“Now we have our gift from the prairie blue" said Jack. "Let your thoughts rise as high as this feather.”

“Hey, I just had a thought!” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“I bet Teddy had something to do with White Buffalo Woman," she said.

“Why?” asked Jack.

“One second Teddy disappeared in the grass. Then White Buffalo Woman appeared,” said Annie. "When White Buffalo Woman disappeared, Teddy appeared.”

“Hmm..." said Jack. He stared at the little dog.

Teddy tilted his head and gave Jack a wise look.

“Well...” said Jack, “maybe Teddy has good medicine."

“Now you understand,” said Annie, smiling.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” A call came from the distance.

Jack and Annie looked out the window of the tree house.

Their mom and their grandmother were standing on their porch.

“Yay, Grandmother's here!" said Annie.

“We're coming!" they shouted together.

“Let's put Teddy in your backpack,” said Annie. “So we can take him home with us this time."

"Okay,” said Jack.

But when they turned around, the little dog was gone.

“Teddy?” said Annie

There was no sign of him.

“Oh, man, as soon as we turned our backs. he slipped away" said Jack. “Just like last time."

“Don't worry,” said Annie. “He’ll find us again soon. I'm sure of it," She started down the rope ladder.

Jack grabbed his pack and followed.

As they started for home, a wind gusted through the trees.

Jack stopped for a moment to look at the woods.

Branches waved their leaves.

Birds left the branches and swooped up into the blue sky.

Black Hawk's grandmother is right, he thought. All things are related.

“Jack!” called Annie.

“Coming!” said Jack.

He hurried to catch up with her.

Together they ran out of the Frog Creek woods...up their street...and into their own grandmother's arms.



## THE LEGEND OF WHITE BUFFALO WOMAN

Long ago, when the Lakota had no game to hunt. a beautiful woman in white buckskins appeared. She gave the chief of the tribe a special pipe. It had a buffalo carved on its round bowl and eagle feathers hanging from its long wooden stem.

White Buffalo Woman told the chief that the smoke from the sacred pipe would carry prayers to the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit would answer by helping the Lakota find buffalo to hunt.

White Buffalo Woman also said that the pipe smoke would join all living things to the Lakota tribe.

The pipe bowl represented the earth.

The buffalo carved upon it represented all four-legged animals that live upon the earth.

The pipe's wooden stem represented all that grows on the earth.

The twelve eagle feathers hanging from it represented all the winged creatures.

As White Buffalo Woman walked away from the tribe, she turned into a white buffalo calf-one of the rarest animals of all.

The legend of White Buffalo Woman has been handed down from generation to generation by Lakota people.



## MORE FACTS FOR YOU ANDJACK

1)The Lakota tribe has also been called the Sioux.

2)Today most Lakota live on reservations in North and South Dakota.(“Reservations" are areas of land reserved for Native Americans by the U.S. government.) Lakota parents and grandparents still pass on the traditional beliefs of their people to their children.

3)The true name of the buffalo is bison. Bison came to North America during the IceAge and at one time were the biggest group of large mammals on the continent.



4)In the 1800s, the US. Army was at war with the Native Americans of the plains. They knew the Native American way of life could not survive without the bison. So they decided to kill all the herds. In the years that followed, millions of bison were killed until there were only a few hundred left.

5)In the early 1900s, many people were upset by the killing of the bison. They asked the government to help save these animals. Captive bison were sent to Yellowstone National Park and protected from hunters. Almost 2,500 bison live there today.





# Tigers at Twilight

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5-8, Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9-12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13-16, Jack and Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17-20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free an enchanted dog from a spell. They have already received a gift on a trip to the Titanic and a gift from the Lakota Indians. Now they are about to set out in search of the third gift ...



## 1：How Far Away?

Jack and Annie walked past the Frog Creek woods on their way home from the library.

“I miss Teddy,” said Annie.

“Me, too," said Jack.

“He's a really smart dog," said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack, "and brave."

“And wise," said Annie.

“And funny," said Jack.

“And here!” said Annie.

“What?" said Jack.

“Here!" Annie pointed at the Frog Creek woods.

A small dog with tan-colored fur was peeking out from the bushes.

Arf! Arf! he barked.

“Oh, wow! Teddy!" said Jack.

The little dog ran off into the woods.

“Let's go!" said Annie.

She and Jack raced after Teddy. The Frog Creek woods glowed with late afternoon sunlight.

The dog ran between the trees and finally stopped at a rope ladder. It hung from the tallest oak tree and led up to the magie tree house.

Teddy waited forJack and Annie to catch up. He panted and wagged his tail.

“Hi, you!” cried Annie. She picked up the little dog and hugged him. "We missed you!"

“Yeah, silly!” said Jack He kissed Teddy. Teddy licked his face.

“Is it time to get our third gift?" asked Annie.

Teddy sneezed, as if to say, Of course!

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack put Teddy inside his backpack and followed.

They climbed into the tree house. There was the note from Morgan le Fay. It was on the floor, just where it had been two days ago.

Jack let Teddy out of his pack. 

Annie picked up the note and read:

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

​		A gift from a ship lost at sea,
​		A qift from the prairie blue,
​		A gift from a forest far away,
​		A gift from a kangaroo.
​		Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.
​													Morgan

Jack touched the first two gifts, which they had already gotten: a pocket watch from the Titanic and an eagle's feather from the Lakota Indians of the Great Plains.

“Now we have to get the gift from a forest far away" said Annie.

“I wonder how far away?" said Jack. 

“I know how to find out," said Annie. “Where's our book?”

She and Jack looked around the tree house for one of the research books that Morgan always left them.

Arf! Arf! Teddy pawed a book in the corner.

Jack picked it up and read the title: Wildlife of India.

“Oh, man. India," he said. “That's very far away,”

"Let's get going,” said Annie, "so we can free Teddy."

Jack pointed at the cover of the book.

“I wish we could go there," he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

But only for a moment...



## 2：Kah and Ko

The warm air burst with sound

Kah-ko!

Eee-eee!

Akkk-awkk!

”What's going on?” said Jack.

He and Annie looked out the window. 

The sky was lit by an orange glow as the sun went down.

The tree house was in a tree by a stream at the edge of a forest.

The wild screeching and cawing came from the forest's tall, leafy trees.

Just then, two creatures leaped onto the windowsill.

“Aaah!” Jack and Annie yelled, jumping back.

Annie burst out laughing.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

Two small monkeys peered at them. Their dark faces were framed with light gray fur. They looked as if they were wearing tiny parkas

“Hi,” said Annie. “I'm Annie. He's Jack. And he's Teddy. What are your names?”

Kah-ko kah-ko. the monkeys chattered.

“Cool,” said Annie. She turned to Jack. “Her name is Kah. His name is Ko."

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

“I bet he is her brother," said Annie.

Kah and Ko whooped as if laughing at Annie's joke. Their yellow eyes twinkled.

“We came to get a gift from the forest," said Annie. "Do you know where we can find it?”

The monkeys nodded and chattered. Then they started down the tree.

Using their long tails and arms, they swung from branch to branch. They jumped to the ground and looked up.

"Coming! Bring Teddy, Jack,” Annie said. Then she started down the ladder.

Jack quickly flipped through Wildlife of India. He found a picture of the gray monkeys. He read:

​			This monkey is called a langur (saylun-GOOR).
​			The word langur means “having a long tail."

Jack pulled his notebook and pencil out of his backpack. He wrote:

​		langur means long tail

Annie's laughter came from below. It blended with the sounds of the forest.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“Okay, okay" said Jack.

He put the book, his notebook, and Teddy into his pack. Then he hurried down the ladder.

Annie was playing with the langurs on the stream bank.

Jack put Teddy on the ground.

Kah bounded over to Jack and grabbed his hand. The langur's paw felt like a tiny human hand.

Kah pulled Jack toward the forest. Ko pulled Annie, and Teddy scampered after them.

The langurs climbed the huge, leafy trees. Then they began swinging from branch to branch, like kids on a jungle gym.

Annie dashed beneath the swinging monkeys. Teddy ran after her.

“Wait, wait!” Jack called, hurrying after them all. “Annie, slow down! We don't know anything about this place."

The langurs slowed down, as if they understood Jack's words. Jack caught up with Annie. They walked on through the forest.

This is so amazing,” said Annie.

Jack agreed.

The sunset gave the trees a fiery glow.

The hot air smelled sweet.

Blue peacocks spread their tails.

Yellow birds flew from tree to tree.

Small deer ate red flowers in a clearing.

“It's like paradise," said Annie.

“Yeah, but don't forget the title of our book: Wildlife of India," said Jack. “‘Wildlife' means scary animals, too.”

Jack noticed long, deep gashes in a tree as they walked by. He stopped.

“What happened there?" he said.

Annie shrugged and kept walking.

Jack pulled the book out of his pack. There was a picture of a tree with gashes. He read aloud:

​			Tigers sharpen their claws on tree trunks. |
​			They leave big gashes in the bark.

“What?” said Annie. She stopped and looked back at the tree.

“See what I mean?” said Jack. “Tigers live here. And one of them just came this way.”



## 3：Life or Death

“Tigers?” said Annie. “Cool."

Jack read more:

​			A wild tiger eats almost 5,000 pounds of fresh raw meat a year.

“Oh, not so cool," said Annie.

Jack went on:

​			Tigers usually leave elephants alone.
​			And like many smaller cats, tigers often avoid wild dogs.

Teddy growled.

“Wild dogs, not a shrimp like you," Jack said to Teddy. “A tiger would eat you in a minute."

Teddy growled again.

Just then, Kah and Ko  began hooting.

Koo-koo-koo!

The peacocks cried Kok! Kok!

The small deer made short barking sounds and stamped their hooves.

“What's going on?" said Annie. We better put Teddy in my pack," said Jack, “to keep him safe."

Jack slipped the dog into his pack. Teddy's head poked out the top.

“All set?” Jack asked the little dog.

Teddy growled again.

This time, a deep, fierce growl answered back. It seemed to surround them.

Jack's hair stood on end.

“yikes!” said Annie.

“A tiger!” said Jack.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

Kah and Ko screeched at Jack and Annie from their tree.

“They want us to join them!” said Annie. “Come on!” She grabbed a branch and climbed up.

Jack's hands were shaking as he put his backpack on. He grabbed a branch and pushed off the ground. He pulled himself into the tree.

Another growl shook the forest.

“Oh, man," said Jack.

Koo-koo-koo! The langurs climbed higher up the tree.

Jack and Annie followed them, climbing from branch to branch.

The sky above was no longer glowing. The bright orange had faded to a twilight gray.

Jack looked down. He couldn't see the ground at all.

He listened for another scary roar.

Only the cries of frightened forest creatures filled the air.

“Maybe the tiger's gone," said Annie.

Jack glanced at Kah and Ko. The langurs cuddled together. Their dark faces looked worried.

“And maybe not," said Jack. 

“How can we get through the forest without running into him?” said Annie.

“That's a problem” said Jack. “And it's getting dark. Soon we won't be able to see anything."

Kah and Ko hooted again. They pointed down the tree trunk.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack's pack.

“Do they see the tiger?” Jack asked, his heart thumping again. He couldn't see anything but leaves and branches.

Then, far below, he saw the tree trunk move!

“A snake!” said Annie.

The snake was slithering around the trunk. It had black-and-tan markings. The snake's body was as thick as the tree trunk!

“A python," breathed Jack.

The python kept curling up the tree trunk.

“Is it poisonous?” asked Annie.

Jack pulled out their book. By the last light of day, he found a picture of a python. He read aloud:

​			The python is not a poisonouis snake.

“Whew," said Annie.

“Not so fast," said Jack, He read more:

​			To kill its prey, the python squeezes it to death, then swallows it whole.
​			A python can swallow an animal the size of a full grown deer.

"Oh, yuck!” said Annie.

“This is more than just yuck, Annie," said Jack. "This is life or death."

Kah and Ko chattered at Jack and Annie.

“Not now," said Jack. “We have to think."

The langurs grabbed thick vines. They leaned back. Then they jumped out of the tree.

The langurs swung through the air like trapeze artists. They swung over bushes and tall grass and landed in another tree.

They screeched at Jack and Annie and waved their arms.

“I know what they're saying,” said Annie. “They want us to copy them!”



## 4：Swing Time

Annie grabbed a vine.

Jack looked back at the python. The giant snake was still winding its way up the tree. It had almost reached their branch.

Jack took a deep breath. Then he grabbed a vine, too.

“Lean back like Kah and Ko did,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie leaned back.

“One, two, three——go!" said Annie.

They swung out of the tree.

Jack felt his stomach drop. Air rushed by. Leaves and branches slapped at him.

Suddenly, the forest shook with a great roar.

Like a flame, a tiger leaped up from the bushes!

His yellow eyes blazed. His teeth shone like daggers. His claws barely missed Jack and Annie!

“AAAHHH!” they yelled.

The tiger crashed back down into the bushes.

Jack and Annie swung into the langurs tree.

Jack threw one leg around the trunk. He let go of his vine and held on tightly to a branch.

“Oh, man!” he said. He was in shock.

The langurs patted him, as if to make sure he was okay.

“Wow, that was fun," said Annie, sitting on a big branch.

“Fun? Are you nuts?" said Jack.

“The swinging was fun," said Annie. "The tiger was scary.”

Just then, the tree began to  shake.

Branches snapped below.

“Oh, no!" said Jack.

“Can tigers climb trees?” asked Annie.

 “Probably.” said Jack. He hugged the trunk and squeezed his eyes shut.

From below came loud sounds of chewing, smacking, and crunching.

Teddy growled.

Jack groaned.

“Now the tiger's eating the tree," he said.

Annie burst into laughter.

Kah and Ko whooped as if they were laughing. too.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“What?” said Jack, opening his eyes.

“Look!” Annie pointed at the twilight.

A thick gray tube was waving in the air.

“Another snake?” said Jack, horrified.

“No! An elephant trunk!" said Annie.

The trunk wiggled near Jack and Annie. as if it were sniffing them. Then it picked leaves from the tree and disappeared."

“Let's go see!" said Annie.

With Teddy still in his backpack, Jack followed Annie down to a lower branch.

They peered out at the twilight forest. In the gray gloom, they saw a herd of elephants.

One stood beneath their tree, eating leaves. Others munched grass.

“Hey, I've got a really cool idea,” said Annie.



## 5：Night Walk

“Uh-oh," said Jack. “What is it?”

“I know how to escape the tiger,” said Annie, "Our book said tigers don't attack elephants, right?“

”Yeah," said Jack.

"So we should travel through the forest on the back of an elephant," said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly.

“That is a cool idea," he said. "But——"

“No buts. I'll get on first," said Annie.

She climbed down the tree until she was close to the elephant's back. She carefully lowered herself off a branch. When her feet rested on the elephant's back, she let go of the branch. Then she slowly sat down.

The elephant let out a low rumbling sound and shifted her weight.

“Don't worry, it's just me,” Annie said softly. She patted the huge creature's back. “Thanks, Saba.”

“Saba?” said Jack.

“That's her name,” said Annie. “She just told me."

“Yeah, right,” said Jack.

Arf! Arf! barked Teddy.

“Come on, Jack," said Annie. “It's not scary.”

Jack sighed and slowly climbed down the tree. When he was above Saba, he lowered himself off the branch.

He put both feet on the elephant. Then he carefully sat down in front of Annie.

Saba rumbled again.

“Tell her not to worry,” said Annie. “Pat her head."

“Don't worry Saba," Jack said. He patted the elephant's head. Her skin was rough and wrinkled.

The elephant curled her trunk back and rested it on Jack's head.

"Hi," he said in a small voice.

Saba flapped her ears.

Kah and Ko swung to the ground in front of Saba. They chattered at her. She waved her trunk at them. The langurs began bounding through the forest.

Saba followed.

The rest of the herd followed in line. Saba walked with a calm, rolling motion. Jack feltas if he were riding over ocean waves.

A full moon was rising above the trees.

“Where are we going?" Jack asked.

“Just relax,” said Annie. “Kah and Ko know where to go."

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack's backpack.

“You relax, too,” Jack said to the little dog.

Fireflies blinked. The moon lit a path between the trees as the elephants marched on.

From a distance came a low growl.

Is that the tiger? Jack wondered.

The elephants paid no attention. They kept walking through the warm woods. They marched slowly under hanging vines and through misty clearings.

Kah and Ko bounded ahead of them, two moon shadows leading the way.

“We're going far from the tree house,” said Jack.

“Don't worry,” Annie said.

Suddenly, a long roar split the night.

A chill went down Jack's spine.

The roar came again. It. turned into a yowling. The yowling turned into steady moaning. It sounded as if the whole forest were moaning

“That's a really sad sound," said Annie sleepily.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

But the elephants all arched on.

Jack rocked in sleepy rhythm with Saba's walk. He could hear Teddy snoring in his backpack.

Soon Jack's head rested on Saba's back. He began drifting in and out of dreams——dreams of rocking in a boat under the dark treetops.



## 6：Swamp Creature

Caw! Caw!
Awk! Awk! Awk!

Jack slowly came out of his dream. He opened his eyes with a start.

He was surrounded by hazy sunlight. 

Where am I? he thought in a panic.

Then he remembered——he was in India, on an elephant's back!

He sat up. Through the haze, he saw that Saba was standing on a muddy stream bank.

Jack yawned. Where was Annie?

The other elephants were upstream. They sprayed water on each other with their trunks.

Teddy, Kah, and Ko were at the edge of the forest. Teddy sniffed the tall grass. The langurs ate flowers.

“Good morning!” called Annie.

She was sitting on a big black rock downstream. She was barefoot and soaking wet.

“Hi," said Jack. "How did you get down?”

“Teddy and I slid off Saba into the mud,” said Annie. “Try it. But throw down your sneakers and backpack first."

Annie went to Saba's side. Her feet were buried in mud up to her ankles.

Jack threw his things to Annie. Then he patted Saba's rough wrinkled skin.

“Thanks for the ride," he said softly.

The elephant touched him one last time with her trunk.

Jack slid down her side——feet first——and fell into the mud. He caught himself with his hands. They sank into the mud past his wrists. His glasses were spattered, too.

”Wash off in the stream," Annie said.

She put Jack's pack and shoes on the rock while Jack waded into the cool water.

He washed the mud off his hands and feet. He rinsed off his glasses. Then he looked around.

Saba had joined the rest of the herd. The elephants looked beautiful in  the morning mist.

Everything looked beautiful.

Yellow and blue water birds spread their wings. Mossy hanging vines swayed in the breeze. Huge white flowers floated on top of the stream.

Then Jack saw a strange sight. It looked like a horn and two ears sticking out of the water. One ear flicked away a fly.

“There's a weird creature out here,” he called to Annie. “It looks like it has a horn.” Annie waded into the stream.

“I better check the book," said Jack. He hurried to his pack, wiping his wet hands on his T-shirt. He pulled out the India book.

There was a picture of a horn sticking out of the water He read:

​			The one-horned rhinoceros, or "rhino," washes in a forest stream.
 		  Rhinos are not usually dangerous. 
​			But becanse they do not see well. they sometimes charge at things by mistake. 
​			A loud noise will usually stop them.

Jack felt sorry for the rhinos. Too bad animals can't wear glasses, he thought. He read more:

​			The Indian rhino is a very endangered animal. 
​			This means that there are not many left. 
​			People called poachers kill them and sell their body parts as medicine and good-luck charms.

Jack started to take out his notebook.

Just then, a slurpy, sloshing sound came from the water.

“Whoa!" said Annie.

Jack looked up.

The rhino rose from the stream He looked like an ancient swamp creature.

“Oh, man!" said Jack.

The rhino peered at Annie with his tiny eyes.

Then he snorted and lowered his head. His horn pointed right at Annie.

“Make a loud noise!” Jack yelled.

Annie clapped her hands and shouted, “We come in peace!”

The rhino stopped. He grunted. Then he sank back into the water.

Annie laughed.

“Whew,” said Jack. “I better take some notes about that big guy."

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from the edge of the forest.

“And I better get Teddy,” said Annie.

She hurried out of the stream and ran to get the dog. Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			one-horned rhino
​		an endangered animal
​			needs glasses

“Jack!” shouted Annie. She was racing toward him, with Teddy at her heels. “Come quick!”

“What's wrong?” he said

“We found something terrible!” Annie was close to tears. "Really terrible!”



## 7：Trapped！

Jack threw his things into his pack and followed Annie to the forest edge.

Teddy stayed close to them, whining. Kah and Ko bounced around, chattering nervously.

As Jack got closer, he saw a tiger. The tiger was lying on his side, completely still. His eyes were closed. His front paw was caught in a trap.

"Is he dead?” said Jack.

“No, he's still breathing,” Annie said. A tear ran down her cheek. “He's worn out from struggling. He must have gotten caught last night. That's the sad sound we heard."

“What can we do?” said Jack.

“We have to free him!” said Annie. She started toward the tiger.

“Wait! Wait!” Jack grabbed her. "Tigers eat people, you know." He took a deep breath. “Let's see what the book says first."

“Hurry,” said Annie.

Jack opened their India book. He found a chapter called “Tiger Traps.” He read:

​			Poachers catch Indian tigers with steel traps.
​			This is against the law. 
​			After trapping a tiger, they kill it and sell the body parts for money.
​			Like the rhino, the tiger is a very endangered species.
​			 If the killing does not end, they both face extinction. 
​			Extinction means that someday there may be no Indian tigers or rhinos left on earth.

“Oh, man, we do have to save him,” said Jack.

Under the writing was a picture of a steel trap used to catch tigers. Jack studied it. Itlooked horrible and deadly.

“Okay," he said He showed the picture to Annie. “Here's the plan I'll push down on this part. The trap will spring open. Then you pullhis leg out. Got it?”

“Got it," said Annie. "Sit, Teddy.”

The little dog sat.

The langurs watched silently as Jack and Annie moved closer to the tiger.

He was the most majestic creature Jack had ever seen. His huge head was a dark orange color. He had perfect black-and-white stripes around his wide face.

The leg in the ugly steel trap was bleeding.

Slowly, silently, Jack pushed down the lever.

He raised the bar off the tiger's leg.

The tiger kept sleeping.

Slowly, silently, Annie freed the tiger's leg.

She stroked his fur gently.

“Get well," she whispered.

The tiger didn't move.

Slowly, silently, Jack and Annie stood up. They turned around. They started tiptoeing back toward the langurs.

Koo-koo-koo! warned Kah and Ko.

Jack and Annie turned back.

The tiger was on his feet. He stared right at them. His eyes seemed to glow.

Jack looked about wildly. How could they escape?

The tiger snarled at Jack and Annie.

Then slowly, silently, he started toward them.



## 8：Wonder Dog

The huge tiger limped closer and closer to Jack and Annie.

Jack clapped his hands.

“We come in peace!" he shouted.

But the tiger didn't turn away. His eyes blazed. His lip curled.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked fiercely at Annie.

“Teddy says run and hide!" said Annie. 

She grabbed Jack's hand and pulled him over to the bank.

“Wait——what about Teddy?" he cried.

“Don't worry!” Annie said.

She pulled Jack down behind the black rock.

“What about Teddy?” Jack asked again.

"He's okay——he told me!" said Annie.

Jack heard Teddy's barks turn to fierce growls.

ARF!ARFIGRRRIGRRRR!

The growls grew louder and louder.

“That doesn't sound like Teddy," said Jack.

Then suddenly, there was silence. A strange silence.

“Teddy?” Annie asked. Now she sounded worried.

Annie raised her head. She and Jack both peered over the rock.

Teddy stood tall and brave in the grass.

The tiger was limping away. He disappeared between the trees.

All the forest seemed to hold its breath——until Annie broke the silence.

”Teddy, you're a wonder dog!" she said.

The langurs clapped and jumped up and down.

Arf! Arf! Teddy was just like a small scruffy dog again. He wagged his tail and ran to Annie and Jack.

Annie scooped him into her arms.

“You saved us!" she said.

“How did you drive away that tiger?" asked Jack, rubbing Teddy's head. “Did you turn into a wild dog?”

Teddy just panted and licked them both.

Jack pushed his glasses into place and looked back at the forest.

“Well, I guess we won't be getting a thank-you gift from that tiger," he said.

Annie laughed.

“I guess not,” she said. "I wonder where our gift is.”

"And I wonder where the tree house is," said Jack.

Kah and Ko chattered at Jack. Then they bounded down the bank, waving their arms.

“They want us to follow them again," said Annie. “Come on."

She and Jack grabbed their things off the rock. They hurried down the stream after the langurs.

The water shimmered in the early light.

Silver fish leaped into the air.

Teddy bounded ahead with Kah and Ko. Soon they disappeared around a bend.

Jack and Annie followed them.

When they went around the bend, they saw a man sitting cross-legged on a rock. The langurs sat close to him.

The man's eyes were closed.

He had long white hair and a long white beard. His skin was brown.

He looked very peaceful.



## 9：The Hermit

Kah and Ko smoothed the man's hair with their little paws and patted his cheeks gently.

The man smiled and whispered to the langurs. His eyes stayed closed.

Teddy walked up to the man and licked his hands.

The man still didn't open his eyes. But he stroked Teddy's fur.

“Knock, knock," Annie said softly. 

“Is someone there?" the man asked.

He turned his face toward Jack and Annie. Now his eyes were open, but he did not seem to see them. Jack realized that the man was blind.

“Hi, I'm Annie,” said Annie.

“And I'm Jack," said Jack.

The blind man smiled.

"Good," he said, nodding. “Would you like to visit with me?”

“Sure," said Annie.

She and Jack sat down next to the man.

“Do you live in this forest?” Annie asked.

"Yes," he said.

“Are you a hermit?” Jack asked.

“Yes." the blind man said.

“What's a hermit?” said Annie.

“Hermits live far away from other people,” said the blind man. "We like to be alone to think. I live in the forest so I can learn from nature.”

“How do you learn?” asked Jack.

“I listen," said the blind man.

“Listen to what?” asked Jack.

To the chatter of the monkeys, the rumble of the elephant, the roar of the tiger," said the man. “I have listened for so long, they have all begun to sound like one voice——the one great voice of the forest."

“Did the voice tell you that a tiger got caught in a trap last night?” asked Annie.

“Yes," the hermit said.

“And did it tell you that after we saved him, he tried to attack us?" said Jack.

The blind man smiled

“Please bring me one of the white flowers floating on the stream," he said.

Jack wondered why the hermit was changing the subject.

But Annie jumped up and hurried to the stream. She pulled at one of the large flowers. It came up, muddy root and all. She took it to the blind man.

“Thank you," he said.

The man touched the flower's large white petals and its dirty root.

This perfect lotus blossom grows from dark, thick mud," he said. “Its beauty cannot live without its ugliness. Do you understand?”

“Yes" said Jack and Annie.

“When you saved the tiger, you saved all of him," said the blind man. “You saved his graceful beauty——and his ferce, savage nature. You cannot have one without the other.”

“Oh...right," said Jack.

“Take this lotus as a thank-you gift from all the forest for saving our fierce friend," said the blind man. “Our world would not be complete without him."

Annie took the gift from the hermit.

“A gift from a forest far away," she said.

Arf! Arf! Teddy wagged his tail.

The langurs clapped.

“We can go home now," said Jack, "if we can just find the way.”

“Do not worry," said the blind man. “Your house in the trees is close by. The elephants walked in a large circle. So you are back at the place where you started."

“Really?” said Jack.

The blind man pointed to the sky.

There was the magic tree house, high in a nearby tree.

“Oh, great," breathed Jack.

"I told you not to worry," said Annie. She and Jack pulled on their socks and shoes and stood up.

Before they left, Annie touched the hand of the blind man.

“Thanks for everything," she said.

The man held her hand for a moment. Then he took Jack's hand. Jack felt a wave of calm wash over him.

“Thank you," he said to the blind man.

Kah and Ko chattered and held out their long arms. Jack and Annie hugged the two langurs.

“We'll miss you," said Annie.

“You were great tour guides," said Jack. “Good-bye.”

Then he and Annie took off for the magic tree house with Teddy scampering after them.

At the rope ladder, Jack put Teddy into his pack and climbed up.

Annie carried the lotus blossom as she followed them.

Inside the tree house, Jack picked up the Pennsylvania book. But before he made a wish, he looked out the window with Annie.

In the distance, they saw Saba and the other elephants bathing in the stream.

They saw Kah and Ko swinging on vines. They saw the tiger sunbathing in the grass, licking his sore leg.

They saw tiny deer grazing.

They saw bright birds in the trees.

They saw the blind man sitting in front of his cave. He was smiling.

Jack opened the book. He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go home," he said.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind started to blow.

It blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.





## 10：Who Are You,Really?

Jack opened his eyes.

Late afternoon sunlight shined into the tree house.

“Our third gift," said Annie.

She put the lotus blossom beside the pocket watch from the Titanic and the eagle's feather from the Lakota Indians.
“One more gift," she said to Teddy, "and you'll be free from your spell."

The little dog licked her hand.

“Hey, tell me this,” said Jack. “How did you know Teddy wanted us to hide behind that rock?”

Annie shrugged.

“I just knew,” she said. “I think I saw it in his eyes."

“You did?” Jack looked into Teddy's eyes.

The little dog tilted his head and stared back at Jack.

Teddy's eyes twinkled, as if they held many secrets.

“Who are you, really?” whispered Jack.

Teddy just smiled a doggy smile and wagged his tail.

“Come for us again soon,” Annie said. “Okay?”

Teddy sneezed, as if to say, Of course!

Jack grabbed his pack. Then he and Annie climbed down the rope ladder.

When they stood on the ground, they looked up. A little black nose was poking out the tree house window.

“Bye!” they called.

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie took off between the trees.

Birds sang in the twilight. Squirrels scampered playfully through the leaves.

The Frog Creek woods were very tame after the forest in India.

Soon they came to their street. As they walked to their house, the last bit of daylight was slipping away.

Before they went inside, Jack and Annie sat on their steps.

“I have two questions," said Jack. "If the hermit couldn't see, how did he know about the tree house? And how did he know that we had traveled all night with the elephants?”

“Easy," said Annie. “The one great voice of the forest told him.”

“Hmm,” said Jack.

He closed his eyes for a moment and listened.

He heard a car going down the street.

He heard a wood pecker pecking.

He heard crickets chirping.

He heard a screen door opening.

He heard a mom saying, “Time for dinner, kids."

All the sounds were like one great voice the one great voice of home.





# Dingoes at Dinnertime

## Prologae

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-yearold Jack and his seven-year old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, Jack and Annie discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House Books #5-8,Jack and Annie helped free Morgan from a spell. In Books #9-12, they solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians.

In Magic Tree House Books #13-16, Jackand Annie had to save four ancient stories from being lost forever.

In Magic Tree House Books #17-20, Jack and Annie must be given four special gifts to help free an enchanted dog from a spell. They have already received a gift on a trip to the Titanic, a gift from the Lakota Indians, and a gift from a forest in India. Now they are about to set out in search of their last gift..



## 1：The Last Gift

Annie sat on the porch steps. She stared down the street at the Frog Creek woods.

“Hey, Jack," she said. “Do you hear it?” Jack sat next to her. He was reading a book.

“Hear what?” he said.

“Teddy's calling us," said Annie.

“You're kidding," said Jack. But he looked down the street and listened, too.

A faint bark came from the distance.

Arf! Arf!

A big smile crossed Jack's face.

“You hear it!" Annie said.

“Yep," said Jack, “You're right. Time to go."

He stood up and grabbed his backpack.

“Be back soon!” Annie shouted through the screen door.

“Don't be late for dinner!" their dad called.

“We won't!” said Jack.

He and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Soon they came to the tallest oak.

There was the magic tree house. A little black nose stuck out the window.

“Hi, silly!” Annie called. We're coming!”

Arf! came a happy bark.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing.

Jack followed her up into the tree house.

A small dog sat in a circle of afternoon sunshine. His tail wagged.

“Hey, Teddy!" said Jack.

Jack and Annie hugged Teddy. And the dog licked both of them.

“Morgan's note is still here," said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. He knew the note by heart now.

This little dog is under a spell and needs your help. To free him, you must be given four special things:

​		A gift from a ship lost at sea.
​		A gift from the prairie blue.
​		A gift from a forest far away.
​		A gift from a kangaroo.
​		Be wise. Be brave. Be careful.
​														Morgan

Beside the note were the gifts from their first three trips:

1.a pocket watch from the Titanic

2.an eagle's feather from the prairie skies

3.a lotus flower from a forest in India

“We just need to get a gift from a kangaroo," said Annie, "and Teddy will be free from his spell."

“We must be going to Australia,” said Jack. “That's where kangaroos live."

“Cool," said Annie.

Teddy whined and scratched at a book lying in the corner.

Jack picked it up.

“What'd I tell you?” he said.

He showed the cover to Annie. The title was Adventure in Australia.

“Great," said Annie. She looked at Teddy.

“Ready to meet a kangaroo?”

Arf! Arf!

Jack opened the book. He found a page with small pictures of different animals and a big picture of a forest. Jack pointed at the forest.

“I wish we could go there," he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still

Absolutely still.



## 2：Sleepyhead

Jack opened his eyes. Glaring hot sunlight flooded into the tree house.

”Neat hats," said Annie.

She and Jack were both wearing hats.

“I think they will protect us from the sun,“ said Jack.

He and Annie looked out the window. Teddy looked out, too.

The tree house had landed in a scrubby forest filled with droopy plants and dry brown trees.

“Man, this place needs rain,” said Jack.

He sat back on his heels and looked at the picture of where they had landed in the Australia book.

He read:

​			Australia's forests go throngh times of drought (say DROWT). 
​			A dronght is along period of time without any rain.
​			The same forest can be flooded by heavy rains at other times of the year.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			drought = no rain

“Hey, Jack,” said Annie. "Doesn't it smell like a cookout?”

Jack sniffed the air. It did smell like a cookout.

Jack looked out the window. A wisp smoke floated above some trees in the distance.

“Maybe people are camping over there," Jack said.

“Let's go see," said Annie.

Jack put his notebook and the Australia book into his backpack.

“Put Teddy in there, too," said Annie.

Jack slipped the little dog into the pack. Then he followed Annie down the ladder.

When they stepped onto the ground, the hot wind nearly blew their hats off.

“The campers must be over there," said Annie.

She pointed at the smoke in the blue sky. They started walking across a sun-baked clearing.

They passed bushes and scrawny trees. Lizards ran over the dry cracked ground.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from Jack's pack.

“Whoa!” said Jack.

A pair of huge, funny-looking birds walked out from behind a bush.

They were taller than Jack. They had fat bodies, long, skinny legs, and long, skinny necks.

“Who are you?” Annie asked the strange pair.

Jack opened his pack and took out the Australia book. He found a picture of the birds.

“They're emus” he said. He read aloud:

​			The emu (say EE-myoo) is a large bird that doesn't fly.
​			It can run as fast as thirty miles per hour.

“Wow, that's fast,” said Annie.

Arf! Teddy jumped out of Jack's backpack and barked at the strange birds.

The emus gave the little dog a haughty look. Then they turned and walked proudly away.

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​				Emu
​			proud birds
​			don't fly

“Look, a live teddy bear!” said Annie.

Jack looked up.

Annie ran to a tree at the edge of the clearing. The "live teddy bear" was nestled in the fork of the tree.

"Aww, it's so cute!" whispered Annie.

The creature was fast asleep. He had large round ears, a black nose, and a furry body. His feet had long, curved claws. 

“It's a koala bear," said Jack.

“Hi, sleepyhead," Annie said to the koala.

She patted his soft fur. He opened his big eyes and looked calmly at her.

Jack found a koala picture in the Australia book He read:

​			The koala is actually not a bear at all.
​			It's a marsupial (say mar-SOUP-ee-l),like a kangaroo. 
​			A marsupial mother carries her babies in a stomach pouch.

“That's neat,” said Annie.

Jack kept reading:

​			Koalas mostly eat the leaves of gum trees, so cutting down gum trees to clear land has hurt them.
​			Wildfires are also a threat. 
​			Koalas are slow-moving and can't escape the smoke and flames.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			Wildfires are a threat to koalos

“What's wrong, sleepyhead?” Annie asked the koala. “Don't you feel well?”

“Don't worry,” said Jack. “Listen to this——”

He read more from the book:

​			Koalas, like kangaroos, are active at night and sleep during the day, when the sun is hot. 
​			The name "koala” means “no drink," because koalas rarely drink water. 
​			They get moisture from the leaves they eat.

Jack licked his lips. His mouth felt dry.

“Speaking of water," he said, “I'm thirsty."

“Me, too" said Annie.

Teddy was panting, as if he was thirsty, also.

“Let's find those campers," said Jack, sighing. "Maybe they can give us some water.”

Jack put Teddy back into his pack. He tucked the book under his arm, in case he needed to look something up.

They began walking again. Suddenly, there was a loud, harsh cackle.

“Yikes," said Annie.

“What was that?” said Jack.



## 3：Big Foot

The loud cry rang again through the dry air.

Teddy barked.

Jack and Annie turned around in the clearing. It was hard to tell where the sound was coming from.

The terrible cackle came again.

”There!" said Annie.

She pointed at a bird in a gum tree. The bird had brown feathers and a large head with a long beak.

It stared down at Jack and Annie. Then it let out another cackle.

“Weird," said Jack.

He found the bird in his book and read:

​			The kookaburra (say K00K-ah-burr.uh) is the best-known bird of Australia. 
​			There is even a popular song about it. 
​			The kookaburra is also called the “laughing donkey." 
​			This is because the strange sound it makes reminds people of a braying donkey.

“I know that song!" said Annie. She began singing:

​		“Kookaburra sits on the old gum tree-ee.
​		Merry, merry king of the bush is he-ee..."

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​		kookaburra——a big kook

Annie stopped singing. “Hey,” she said. “There's another weird thing.”

“Where?” said Jack.

Annie pointed to a big bluish tan lump lying in a shallow, dusty hole.

“Is it alive?” said Jack.

They stepped closer to the big lump.

“It looks like it's breathing," said Annie.

The lump was an animal lying on its back. Its paws were crossed over its chest.

It had huge feet, large ears, a face like a deer's, and a very long tail. It also had a very fat stomach.

Just then, a small head peered out of its stomach.

”Whoa!" said Jack.

"Oh, wow! It's a kangaroo with her baby in her pouch!" said Annie.

“Great!" said Jack. “Remember, we have to get a gift from a kangaroo!”

Their voices woke the kangaroo. The animal jumped up from her shallow bed.

She glared at Jack and Annie. Her baby peeked out of her pouch.

The mother kangaroo gave an angry stamp.

“Oh, we're sorry!” Annie said. “We didn't mean to wake you up."

The kangaroo eyed Annie curiously. Then she took a giant hop toward her.

Copying the kangaroo, Annie hopped toward the big animal.

The kangaroo hopped again.

Annie hopped.

The kangaroo and Annie began hopping around each other. They looked as if they were dancing.

Jack couldn't believe how graceful the kangaroo was. She seemed to fly through the air, then land as softly as a butterfly.

He looked up “kangaroo" in his book and read:

​			The kangaroo is the most famous of the marsupials. 
​			The female carries her baby, known as a "joey," in her pouch.
​			Scientists call the kangaroo a "macropod," which means "big foot." 
​			And big feet help a kangaroo hop higher than any other animal in the world.
​			With a running leap, a large kangaroo can jump over a school bus.

“Forget the hopping contest, Annie," Jac kcalled. "She can out-hop you by a mile."

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​		Kangardo
​		"big foot"
​		Can jump over a school bus!
The kangaroo began stamping her feet again.

“What's wrong?” said Annie.

The kangaroo froze.

Grrrr! Teddy growled from Jack's backpack.

Some nearby bushes moved

A moment later, three dogs crept silently into the clearing. They were sand-colored and mean-looking.

Teddy growled once more.

But the dogs crept toward the kangaroo.

Suddenly, the mother kangaroo sprang into the air, away from the dogs.

The dogs chased after her. 

“Stop!” cried Annie. “Stop! Leave her alone!”

As the kangaroo jumped, she turned in midair and landed facing a different direction. She then zigzagged over rocks and bushes.

Howling, the wild dogs raced after the kangaroo and her baby.



## 4：Joey

“Oh, no!” cried Annie. “We have to save her!”

She took off after the dogs.

Arf! Arf! Arf! Teddy barked over Jack's shoulder.

Jack ran after Annie with the book under his arm. He ran over the dry, cracked ground, past scrubby bushes and scattered gum trees.

Jack kept his eye on Annie, running ahead of him. He saw her stop suddenly. She turned and dropped to her knees.

“What happened?” he shouted.

"Come look!" she said.

Jack reached Annie. Beside her in the grass was the baby kangaroo. It was trembling.

“Don't be scared," Annie was saying. Then she looked at Jack. “Where's his mom? Why did she drop him?”

“I don't know,” said Jack.

He put his pack on the ground and opened the Australia book. Teddy jumped out of the pack.

The little dog tried to sniff the baby kangaroo.

“Don't scare him, Teddy," Annie said.

Teddy sat back and watched politely.

Jack opened the Australia book and founda picture of a baby kangaroo. He read:

​			The biggest enemy of the kangaroo ist he dingo, the wild dog of Australia.
​			When a mother kangaroo is chased by dingoes, she may throw her joey out of her pouch.
​			Without the extra weight in her pouch, she can leap faster and farther. 
​			She then leads the dingoes away from her baby. 
​			If she escapes the dingoes, she returns to the joey.

“Oh, Jack” Annie said sadly. “I hope his mother escapes from the dingoes."

“Me, too," said Jack.

“Hi, Joey,” said Annie. She gently patted the baby kangaroo. “He's so soft, Jack."

Jack knelt down and touched the brown fur. It was soft, the softest fur he had ever felt.

The shy little kangaroo stared at Jack with big brown eyes and trembled.

“Don't be scared, Joey,” Annie said. "Your mom's going to come back for you."

Joey jumped away from Jack and Annie. He hopped toward Jack's pack, which was sitting on the ground.

The baby kangaroo took a giant leap and dived headfirst into the pack! His whole body went inside, but his big feet stuck out. Then he turned himself over and peeked out atJack and Annie.

They both laughed.

“He thinks your pack is a pouch!” said Annie. “I know. Put it on backward. It will feel like when his mom carries him."

Jack put his Australia book on the ground. Then Annie helped him put the pack on his chest instead of on his back. The joey was heavy!

“There,” Annie said. “You look just like a mother kangaroo."

“Oh, brother," said Jack.

But he patted the baby's soft fur.

“Don't worry," he said to Joey. “You can stay in there till your mom gets back."

“Here, Joey, would you like some grass to eat?" asked Annie.

Annie scooped up a handful of grass and gave it to the kangaroo.

He munched the grass, keeping his big eyes on Annie.

“I hope his mom comes back for him soon, she said worriedly.

“Yeah,” said Jack.

He looked around the dry forest. There was no sign of the mother kangaroo.

But Jack saw something else.

“Look," he said to Annie.

The wisp of smoke in the sky had turned into a big black cloud. Jack noticed the smell of burning wood was much stronger.

"What are those campers doing?” said Annie. “Are they making a bonfire now or what?”

A feeling of dread came over Jack.

“What if..." he said. “What if..."

In the distance, a tree suddenly burst into flames.

“We're looking at a wildfire !" he said.



## 5：Wildfire!

“Wildfire?” said Annie.

“The woods are so dry, everything's starting to burn!” said Jack. “We have to get out of here."

“We can't leave Joey," said Annie. 

We'll take him with us!” said Jack.

“But what if his mom comes back for him and he's not here?" said Annie.

“We don't have a choice" said Jack.

Just then, the kookaburra flew through the sky, cackling.

The emus raced by at top speed.

The air was getting smokier and smokier. The fire was spreading quickly!

“Come on!” said Jack. “We have to get back to the tree house before it burns down!”

“Which way's the tree house?” said Annie.

“I'm not sure," said Jack.

Smoke hid the tree tops. Jack's eyes stung.

“Forget it," he said. “Let's just get away from this smoke. Come on!”

Jack and Teddy turned to go. The baby kangaroo hid his head inside Jack's pack.

“I'll catch up!" said Annie. "I have to get something!”

“What?" cried Jack.

But Annie had dashed off in the other direction.

“Come back!” Jack shouted. “Annie!” 

Branches cracked and fell from the trees. Smoke billowed everywhere.

Arf! Arf!

“Annie!” Jack cried.

Jack choked on the smoke. He coughed and rubbed his eyes. The air was getting hotter.

He had no choice. He had to run.

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked from somewhere ahead.

“Hurry, Annie!” Jack called helplessly.

Then he took off after Teddy.

He stumbled blindly through the brush. All he could do was follow the sound of Teddy's barking. His pack felt heavier and heavier. He held it up with his arms and kept going.

Suddenly, Jack heard Annie calling him.

Jack stopped.

“Here! Here! Here! We're here!” he shouted. “Come on! Follow us!”

Annie appeared through the haze of the hot smoke. She was coughing. Tears streamed from her eyes.

She was carryindg the koala!

“Come on!” Jack cried. “Follow Teddy!”

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie carried Joey and the koala. They followed Teddy's barking through the smoky, fire-filled forest.

Finally, they came to a giant rock.

Arf! Arf!

Teddy was standing on a ledge, Behind him was the mouth of a cave.

Through the smoke, Jack could barely see the little dog.

Teddy barked again, then vanished inside the cave.

“Follow him!” said Annie.



## 6：Hand to Hand

Jack and Annie climbed onto the rock ledge and stepped into the cave. The air inside was cleaner and cooler than the air outside.

"I can't see anything," said Jack.

He patted the head of the baby kangaroo.

“Me neither” said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

“I guess we'll have to follow Teddy's bark," said Annie. "Let's hold hands."

She held out her free hand to Jack. Jack took it. Then he put his other hand out and touched the wall. The joey moved in his pack.

Jack and Annie walked into the darkness.

Arf!

Teddy kept barking, leading them on.

Arf!
Arf!
Arf!
Arf!

Suddenly,Jack felt something thump against his leg. He stopped and gasped.

“What is it?” said Annie.

Arf!

“It was Teddy! His tail was wagging and hitting Jack's leg.

“What is it, boy?” Jack asked him.

Teddy let out a howl.

As he howled, an amazing thing happened.

A white line began to glow in the air. The glowing line grew until it looked like a giant snake. Then glowing handprints appeared below the snake.

Jack felt Annie squeeze his hand.

“I think it's painted on the wall," she said.

“But what is it?” whispered Jack.

“I don't know," said Annie.

She let go of Jack and put her hand inside one of the painted handprints.

Jack did the same.

Despite the glowing painting, the rock felts mooth and cool. It almost seemed to breathe.

A ghost-like whistling sound came through the darkness. Then a loud boom!

“What's that?” Jack quickly took his hand off the wall.

The boom came again.

“It sounded like thunder,” said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

“Teddy's leaving!" said Annie. 

She grabbed Jack's hand. They turned back the way they had come and followed Teddy's barking again.

Arf!

They followed the little dog until they saw a flash of light.

“Lightning,” said Annie. “Lightning and thunder! We're at the front of the cave! Yay!”

Annie pulled Jack toward the mouth of the cave and out, into a pouring rain.



## 7：Rain, Rain, Rain

Rain fell on Jack's head and on Joey's head. Rain fell on Annie's head and on Teddy's head and on the koala's head.

Annie opened her mouth and drank the rainwater.

Jack did the same. The water tasted better than any water he'd ever drunk.

When Jack looked back at the woods. misty steam was rising from the charred ground and burning bushes.

The heavy rain was putting out the wildfire.

“You'll be safe now,” Annie said to the koala. “I'll put you back in a nice gum tree. Then you can finish your nap.”

“I see a tree that's not burned," said Jack.

They walked over to the unburned gum tree. Annie placed the koala in the fork of two branches.

“Go back to sleep now," she said softly. “Pretend the fire was all a dream."

“Good night," said Jack.

The koala seemed to smile at them. Then he closed his eyes and went to sleep, as if he'd never been disturbed at all.

Jack sighed and looked around.

“Man,” he said, “we were lucky that a storm came.”

Annie smiled

“It wasn't just luck," she said. “It was magic.”

“Magic?” said Jack.

“Yeah...the glowing hands and the snake," said Annie. “Somehow they brought the storm."

“That doesn't make sense," said Jack.

Joey stirred in his pack. Suddenly, Jack remembered something.

“Hey. we have to get Joey back to the place where his mom left him," he said. “Or she won't be able to find him."

“Where was that place?” said Annie.

“I don't know," said Jack.

He looked around at the rainy gray forest.

Everything looked the same.

“Teddy can find the spot!" said Annie.

Without even a bark, the little dog took off across the wet,muddy ground.

Once again, Jack and Annie followed him. Jack's back was beginning to hurt from carrying Joey.

Arf! Arf!

Jack and Annie caught up with Teddy. He stood over the Australia book! It was wet, but not burned.

“Hurray, we found it!" said Annie.

“That's right!” said Jack, “I left our book in the spot where we found Joey!”

“Once again, Teddy helped us out,” said Annie.

She patted the little dog's head.

“Thanks, Teddy," Jack said.

He picked up the Australia book. The cover was wet, but the pages looked okay.

The little kangaroo peeked out of his pack as Jack tucked the book under his arm.

“Don't worry, Joey,” Annie said. “We’ll stay right here till your mom comes back for you.”

If she hasn't already come...Jack thought worriedly.

Jack and Annie stood in the rain with Teddy and Joey and waited.

They waited and waited.

The rain turned to a drizzle. Then the drizzle turned to a light sprinkle.

Still, they waited...

Jack grew sadder and sadder.

Maybe the mother kangaroo had come and left. Or maybe she had been caught by the dingoes. Or maybe she had been killed by the wildfire.

Jack was afraid to look at Annie, afraid to say anything.

“I know what you're thinking," she said finally.

Jack patted Joey's head and sighed.

“Let's wait a little longer,” he said. “If she doesn't come back soon, we'll take him home with——”

Arf! Teddy barked softly.

“Listen," said Annie.

Jack listened.

The sound was very faint at first. But then it grew louder.

It was a squishy sound. It was a squashy sound. It was the sound of big feet slapping through mud!



## 8：The Rainbow Serpent

The mother kangaroo bounded out of the trees.

She landed ten feet away from Jack, Annie, Teddy, and Joey.

They all were still for a moment, as if they all were holding their breath. 

Then Joey tried to jump out of Jack's backpack.

“Hold on," said Jack.

He put his pack on the ground.

The little kangaroo leaped out.

He leaped again...then again...and dived headfirst into his mother's pouch!

Joey turned himself over inside the pouch. Then he peeked out at Jack and Annie.

“Yay!" said Jack and Annie together. They laughed and clapped with relief.

“He looks happy to be home," said Annie.

“His mother looks happy, too,” said Jack.

The mother kangaroo was gazing down at her joey. She patted his head with her small paws.

Then she looked at Jack and Annie with soft eyes.

“She's saying thank you to us,” Annie said.

“You're welcome," Jack said.

“It was no problem,” Annie told the kangaroo. "You have a great joey.”

The kangaroo gave a little nod. Then she bent over and used a front paw to pick up a small piece of bark from the wet grass.

The kangaroo held the piece of bark out to Jack and Annie.

Jack took it from her.

“Oh, man,” he whispered. “It's our gift from a kangaroo."

The kangaroo then sprang into the air. She bounded gracefully away through the charred forest.

“Thanks!” called Jack.

“Bye!" called Annie. "Good luck!”

Arf! Arf! Teddy barked.

The rain stopped as Jack studied the piece of bark. There was a tiny painting on it. It was just like the snake painting in the cave.

“I wonder what the snake means," said Jack.

Jack opened the wet cover of the Australia book. He carefully turned the damp pages.He found a picture of the snake painting.

“Listen." said Jack. He read:

​			The first people of Australia are called "Aborigines”(say ab-uh-RIJ-uh-neez).
​			They have lived there for 40,000 years.
​			Their myths take place in a time they call “Dreamtime.”
​			In Dreamtime. there is a Rainbow Serpent, who sends life-giving rain.

​			Aborigine artists paint the Rainbow Serpent on cave walls or on pieces of bark. 
​			In special ceremonies, they sometimes honor the Rainbow Serpent by painting their handprints on the			magic snake.

“See?” said Annie. “That explains everything!”

“Explains what?” said Jack.

“We put our hands on the painting of the Rainbow Serpent,” she said. “It was like a special ceremony. So the Rainbow Serpent sent the rain to put out the wildfire."

Arf! Teddy barked.

Jack frowned.

“But it's not a real creature," he said, “It's in Dreamtime. Not real time.”

Annie smiled.

“Then how do you explain that?" she said. She pointed at the sky.

The rain clouds were gone. The sun had come back out.

A rainbow curved across the blue Australian sky.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. Though the air was warm again he shivered.

“Teddy led us to the painting," said Annie. “We should thank him."

“How did he know about the Rainbow Serpent in the cave?” Jack asked.

“I told you," said Annie. “He has a touch of magic.”

They looked down at the little dog. Teddy tilted his head and seemed to smile.

“Hey, we have all four gifts now!” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah!" said Jack.

“Let's go home and see if Teddy's spell is broken!" said Annie.

Arf! Arf!

Jack put the bark painting and the Australia book in his pack. Then they all headed through the wet, steamy forest in the direction of the tree house.

“I hope the tree house didn't get burned!” he said.

They went past the clearing, past the gum trees and bushes.

The tree house was waiting for them.

“It's still here!" said Annie.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

Jack put Teddy in his pack and followed.

Inside the tree house, Teddy wiggled out of the pack. He pawed the Pennsylvania book.

Arf! Arf!

“Okay, okay,” said Jack. He pointed at a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there!”

“Over the rainbow!” said Annie.

And the wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 9：What Boy?

”Welcome back," came a soft, lovely voice.

Jack opened his eyes.

It was Morgan! They hadn't seen Morganin a long time.

“Morgan!” cried Annie. 

She threw her arms around the enchantress. Jack jumped up and hugged Morgan, too.

“It's good to see you both," said Morgan.

Arf! Arf!

“And it's good to see you, too,” Morgan said, smiling at the little dog.

“Look” said Annie. She reached into Jack's pack and pulled out the piece of painted bark. "A gift from a kangaroo."

“We have all four gifts now," said Jack.

“Good work," said Morgan.

She picked up their first gift. It was the pocket watch from the Titanic.

“Once upon a time, there was a boy who wasted time,” Morgan said. “This watch teaches him that time is very precious. It must be used wisely."

Morgan picked up their second gift, the eagle's feather from the Lakota Indians.

“Sometimes the boy was afraid to stand up for himself” she said. “The eagle's feather teaches him that a small creature can be one of the bravest."

Morgan picked up the lotus flower from the forest in India.

“Sometimes the boy did not respect nature,” she said. “This flower teaches him that nature holds many wonders.”

Morgan picked up the piece of bark with the painting of the Rainbow Serpent.

“Sometimes the boy didn't want to study other times and places," she said, “This painting teaches him there is mystery, magic, and wisdom in the traditions of ancient peoples."

“What boy?” Jack asked.

“Who are you talking about?” asked Annie.

Morgan didn't answer right away. She placed her hands on Jack's and Annie's shoulders.

“Thank you,” she said, “for helping this boy learn his lessons. Thank you for breaking the spell.”

“What boy?” Jack asked again.

Arf! Arf! Arrrrrrif!

Jack and Annie looked over at Teddy.

Then something magical happened.

In a flutter of time...

in the spin of a whirlwind...

Teddy was changed.

He was no longer a dog.

He was a boy.



## 10：Dreamtime

The boy was on the ground on his hands and knees.

“Meet my young helper from Camelot," said Morgan.

The boy glanced up. He had a friendly freckled face and twinkly dark eyes. His hair was the same color that Teddy's fur had been. He looked a bit older than Jack, about ten or so.

“Am I back?” he asked.

“you're back," said Morgan.

The boy leaped up and hugged her.

“Thank you!” he cried.

“And I hope next time you'll ask before trying the spells in my spell book," said Morgan.

The boy grinned sheepishly.

“I promise.” Then he looked at Jack and Anmie. “I accidentally changed myself into a dog," he said.

Annie laughed.

“But at least I got to have exciting adventures as a dog!" he said.

“You were a great dog," said Annie. “We liked you as Teddy. What's your real name?”

“If you like, you can keep calling me Teddy” the boy said. "Or how about Ted?”

“Okay, Ted," said Annie.

Jack just nodded. He was still in shock.

“Ted is training to work in my library at Camelot,” said Morgan. “He has a rare gift for magic.”

“Cool," said Annie.

“You——you helped us a lot, Ted," said Jack, finally finding his voice.

“Oh, no, it was both of you who helped me,” said Ted. "You helped break the spell. And I found new stories to take home."

“you did?" said Annie.

Ted nodded.

The story of the Titanic, the story of White Buffalo Woman, the story of the wounded tiger, and the story of the Rainbow Serpent," he said. “I'll write them down as soon as I get home. So people can read them in Morgan's library."

“And home is where we must go now, I’m afraid,” said Morgan.

“Oh,” said Annie sadly. “That's too bad."

“Yeah," said Jack. He was sad, too.

“I know we will meet again someday,” said Ted.

“I hope so," said Jack.

“Me, too,” said Annie. “Bye!"

She started down the ladder.

Jack pulled on his pack. With a heavy heart, he followed.

When they got to the ground, they looked up.

Morgan and Ted were at the window. They both seemed to glow in the late afternoon light.

“The magic tree house will return for you soon,” said Morgan. “I promise."

She waved, and they waved back.

“Good-bye, Jack and Annie,” she said.

“Arf!” said Ted.

In a flutter of time...

in the spin of a whirlwind...

the magic tree house was gone.

For a long moment, Jack and Annie stared at the empty tree.

“Ready for dinner?” Annie asked softly.

Jack nodded.

He felt dazed as they walked silently through the Frog Creek woods.

When they came to their street, the sun was setting. A flock of black birds flew through the silvery pink sky.

Annie broke their silence as they headed for their house.

We had great adventures with Teddy——I mean Ted——didn't we?" she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “It was like...” He searched for the right words. “Like..."

“Like living in Dreamtime,” said Annie.

“Yeah," said Jack. He smiled.

That was exactly what it was like.



The Rainbow Serpent

In Aborigine myth, the Rainbow Serpent not only brings rain but also helped create the world.

At the beginning of time, the Rainbow Serpent awoke from sleep and pushed through the earth's crust. As it traveled over the empty land, it left behind deep tracks.

The Rainbow Serpent called to the frogs to come out from beneath the earth. It tickled the frogs' bellies, and when they laughed water poured from their mouths. The water filled the Rainbow Serpent's tracks, makingrivers and lakes.

Grass grew Then all creatures-birds.lizards, snakes, kangaroos, koalas, and dingoes——woke up and took their places on the earth.
