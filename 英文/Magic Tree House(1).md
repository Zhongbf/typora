# Dinosaurs Before Dark（恐龙谷历险记）

## Chapter1：Into the woods（走进深林）

“Help, A monster!” said Annie.

“Yeah, sure!” said Jack. “A real monster in the Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”

“Run, Jack” said Annie. She ran up the road

Oh，brother.

This is what he got for spending time with his seven-yesr-old sister

Annie loved pretend stuff. But Jack was eight and a half. He liked real things

“Watch out, Jack! The monster’s coming! Race you!”

“No, thanks!” said Jack

Annie raced alone into the woods. 

Jack looked at the sky. The sun was about to set.==（be about to：表示即将发生，短时间）==

“come on, Annie! It’s time to go home!”

But Annie had disappeared

Jack waited.

No Annie.

“Annie!” he shouted again.

“Jack! Jack! Come here!”

Jack groaned. “This better be good,” he said

Jack left the road and headed into the woods. The tree were lit with golden late-afternoon light.==（headed into：朝...前进；were + 过去分词：表示树被点亮）==

 “Come here!” called Annie.

There she was. Standing under a tall oak tree. “Look,” she said. She was pointing at a rope ladder.

The longest rope ladder Jack had ever seen.

“Wow,” he whispered.

The ladder went all the way up to the top of the tree.

There - at the top - was a tree house. It was tucked  between two branches==（at the top 是插入语）==

“That must be the highest tree house in the world,” said Annie.

“Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.”

“I don’t know But I’m going up,” said Annie

“No, We don’t know who it belongs to,” said Jack

“Just for a teeny minute,” said Annie. She started up the ladder.

“Annie, come back!”

She kept climbing.

Jack sighed. “Annie, it’s almost dark. We have to go home.”==（have to 是情态动词 + go动词原形组成谓语；）==

> have to用法
>
> 情态动词have to（口语常说成have got to）表示客观需要做的事情，意为：不得不/必须

Annie disappeared inside the tree house.

“An-nie!”

Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her head out of the tree house window.
“Books!” she shouted.

“What?”

“It’s filled with books”

Oh, man! Jack loved books.

He pushed his glasses into place. He gripped the sides of the rope ladder, and up he went.


## Chapter2：The Monster（怪兽）

Jack crawled through a hole in the tree house floor.

Wow. The tree house was filled with books. Books everywhere. Very old books with dusty covers. New books with shiny, bright covers. 

“Look. You can see far, far away,” said Annie. She was peering out tree house window.==（was + 现在分词：过去进行时）==

Jack looked out the window with her. Down below were the tops of the other trees. In the distance he saw the Frog Creek library. The elementary school. The park.==（Down below：在下面，倒装句，地点副词位于句首）==

Annie pointed in the other direction.

“There’s  our house,” she said.

Sure enough. There was their white wooden house with the green porch. Next door was their neighbor’s black dog, Henry. He looked very tiny.==（next door：隔壁）==

“Hi Henry!” shouted Annie.

“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be up here.”

He glanced around the tree house again.

“I wonder who owns all these books,” he said. He noticed bookmarks were stick out  of many of them.

“I like this one,” said Annie.  She held up a book with a castle on the covers.

“Here‘s a book about Pennsylvania,” said Jack, He turned to the page with the book-mark.

“Hey, there’s a picture of Frog Creek in here,” said Jack. “It’s a picture of these woods!”

“Oh, here’s a book for you,” said Annie. She help up a book about dinisaurs. A blue silk bookmark was sticking put of it.

“Let me see it.” Jack set down his back-pack and grabbed the book from her.

“You look at that one, and I’ll look at the one about castles,“ said Annie.

“No, we beeter not,” said Jack. “We don’t know who these books belong to.”

But even as he said this, Jack opened there dinosaur book to where the bookmark was. He couldn’t help himself.

He turned to a picture of an ancient flying reptile. A Pteranodon.

He touched the huge bat-like wings.

“Wow,” whispered Jack. “I wish I could see Pteranodon for real.”

Jack studied the picture of  the odd-looking creature soaring through the sky.

“Ahhh!” screamed Annie

“What?” said Jack.

“A monster!” Annie cried. She pointed to the tree house window.

“Stop pretending,  Annie” said Jack.

“No, really! ” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window.

A giant creature was gliding above the treetops! He had a long, weird crest on the back of his head. A skinny beak, And huge bat-like wings!

It was a real live Pteranodon!

The creature curved through the sky. He was coming straight toward the tree house. He looked like a glider plane!

The wind began to blow.

The leaves trembled.

Suddenly the creature soared up.  High into the sky. Jack nearly fell out the window trying to see it.

The wind Picked to. It was whistling now.

The tree house started to spin.

“What’s happening?” cried Jack.

“Get down!” shouted Annie.

She pulled him back from the window.

The tree house was spining. Faster and Faster

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. He held on to Annie.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still

Jack opened his eyes. Sunlight slanted through the window.

There was Annie. The books. His back-pack.

The tree house was still high up in an oak tree.

But it wasn’t the same oak tree


## Chapter3：Where is here（这是哪里）

Jack looked out the window

He looked down at the picture in the book.

He looked back out the window.

The world outside and the world in the picture-they were exactly the same.

The Pteranodon was soaring through the sky. The ground was covered with ferns and tall grass. There was a winding stream. A sloping hill. And volcanoes in the distance.

“Wh---where are we?” stammered Jack.

The Pteranodon glided down to the base of their tree. The creature coasted to a stop. And stood very still.

“What happened to us?” said Annie. She looked at Jack. He looked at her.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I was looking at the picture in the book---”

“And you said, ‘Wow, I wish I could see a Pteranodon for real,’” said Annie.

“Yeah. And then we saw one. In the Frog Creek woods,” said Jack.

“Yeah. And then the wind got loud. And the tree house started spinning,” said Annie.

“And we landed here,” said Jack

“And we landed here,” said Annie.

“So that means . . .” said Jack

“So that means . . . what?” said Annie.

“Nothing,” said Jack. He shook his head. “None of this can be real.”

Annie looked out the window again. “But he’s real,” she said. “He’s very real”

Jack looked out the window with her. The Pteranodon was standing at the base of the oak tree. Like a guard. His giant wings were spread out on either side of him.

“Hi!” Annie shouted.

“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be here.”

“But where is here?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack.

“Hi!” Annie called again to the creature.

The Pteranodon looked up at them.

“You’re nuts He can’t talk,” said Jack. “But maybe the book can tell us.”

Jack looked down at the book. He read the words under the picture:

​		This flying reptile lived in the Cretaceous period. It vanished 65 million years ago.

No. Impossible. They couldn’t have landed in a time 65 million years ago.

“Jack,” said Annie. “He’s nice.”

“Nice?”

“Yeah, I can tell. Let’s go down and talk to him.”

“Talk to him?”

Annie started down the rope ladder.

“Hey!” shouted Jack.

But Annie kept going.

“Are you crazy?” Jack called

Annie dropped to the ground. She stepped boldly up to the ancient creature

## 4：Henry（亨利）

Jack gasped as Annie held out her hand.==（as：在....时候）==

Oh, brother, She was always trying to make friends with animals. But this was going too far.

“Don’t get too close to him, Annie!” Jack shouted.

But Annie touched the Pteranodon’s crest. She stroked his neck. She was talking to him.

What in the world was she saying?

Jack took a deep breath. Okay. He would go down too. It would be good to examine the creature. Take notes. Like a scientist. 

Jack start down the rope ladder. 

When he got to the ground, Jack was only a few feet away from the creature.

The creature stared at Jack. His eyes were bright and alert.

“He’s soft, Jack,” said Annie. “He feels like Henry.”

Jack snorted. “He’s no dog, Annie.”

“Feel him, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack didn’t move.

“Don’t think, Jack. Just do it.”

Jack stepped forward. He put out him arm. Very cautiously. He brushed his hand down the creature’s neck.

Interesting. A thin layer of fuzz covered the pteranodon’s skin.

“Soft, huh?” said Annie.

Jack reached into his backpack and pulled out a pencil and a notebook. He wrote: fuzzy skin.

“What are you doing?” asked Annie.

“Taking notes,” said Jack. “We’re probably the first people in the whole world to ever see a real live Pteranodon.”

Jack looked at the Pteranodon again. The creature had a bony crest on top of his head. The crest was longer than Jack’s arm.

“I wonder how smart he is,” Jack said.

“Very smart,” said Annie.

“Don’t count on it,” said Jack. “His brain’s probably no bigger than a bean”.

“No, he’s very smart. I can feel it,” said Annie. “I’m going to call him Henry.”

Jack wrote in his notebook: small brain?

Jack looked at the creature again. “Maybe he’s a mutant,” he said.

The creature tilted his head.

Annie laughed. “He’s no mutant, Jack.”

“Well, what’s he doing here then? Where is this place?” said Jack.

Annie leaned close to the Pteranodon.

“Do you know where we are, Henry?” she asked softly.

The creature fixed his eyes on Annie. His long jaws were opening and closing.Like a giant pair of scissors.

“Are you trying to talk to me, Henry?” asked Annie.

“Forget it, Annie.” Jack wrote in his notebook: mouth like scissors?

“Did we come to a time long ago, henry?” asked Annie. “Is this a place  from long ago?”

Suddenly she gaspen. “Jack”

He looked up.

Annie was pointing toward the hill. On top stood a huge dinosaur!



## 5：Gold In The Grass（草丛中的金子）

“Go! Go!” said Jack. He threw his notebook into his pack. He pushed Annie toward the rope ladder.

“Bey, Henry!” she said.

“Go!” said Jack. He gave Annie a big push.

“Quit it!” she said. But she started up the ladder. Jack scrambled after her.

They tumbled into the tree house.

They were panting as they looked out the window at the dinosaur. He was standing on the hilltop. Eating flowers off a tree.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We are in a time long ago!”

The dinosaur looked like a huge rhinoceros. Only he had three horns instead of one. Two long ones above his eyes and one on his nose. He had a big shield-like thing behind his head.

“Triceratops!” said Jack.

“Does he eat people?” whispered Annie.

“I’ll look it up.” Jack grabbed the dinosaur book. He flipped through the pages.

“There!” he said. He pointed to a picture of a Triceratops. He read the caption:

​			The Triceratops lived in the late Cretaceous period. This plant-eating dinosaur weight  over 12000 pounds.

Jack slammed the book shut. “Just plants. No meat.”

“Let’s go see him.” said Annie.

“Are you nuts?” said Jack.

“Don’t you want to take notes about him?” asked Annie. “We’re probably the frist people in the whole world to ever see a real live Triceratops.”

Jack sighed. She was right.

“Let’s go,” he said.

He shoved the dinosaur book into his pack. He slung it over his shoulder and started down the ladder.

On the way down, Jack stopped.

He called up to Annie, “Just promise you won’t pet him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t kiss him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t talk to him.”

“I promise.”

“Promise you won’t-----”

“Go! Go!” she said.

Jack went.

Annie followed.

When they stepped off the ladder, the Pteranodon gave them a kind look.

Annie blew a kiss at him. “Be back soon, Henry,” she said cheerfully.

“Shush!” said Jack, And he led the way through the ferns. Slowly and carefully.

When he reached the bottom of the hill, he kneeled behind a fat bush.

Annie knelt beside him and started to speak.

“Shush!” Jack put his finger to his lips.

Annie made a face.

Jack peeked out at the Triceratops.

The dinosaur was incredibly big. Bigger than a truck. He was eating the flowers off a magnolia tree.

Jack slipped his notebook out of his pack. He wrote:

​		eats flowers

Annie nudged him.

Jack ignored her. He studied the Triceratops again. He wrote：

​		eats slowly

Annie nudged him hard.

Jack looked at her.

Annie point to herself. She walked her fingers through the air. She pointed to the dinosaur. She smiled.

Was the teasing?

She waved at Jack.

Jack started to grab her.

She laughed and jumped away. She fell into the grass. In full view of the Triceratops!

“Get back!” whispered Jack.

Too late. The big dinosaur had spotted Annie. He gazed down at her from the hilltop. Half of a magnolia flower was sticking out of his mouth.

“Oops,” said Annie.

“Get back!” Jack shouted at her.

“He looks nice, Jack.”

“Nice? Watch out for his horns, Annie!”

“No. He’s nice, Jack.”

Nice?

But the Triceratops just gazed calmly down at Annie. Then he turned and loped away. Down the side of the hill. 

“Bey!” said Annie. She turned back to Jack. “See?”

Jack grunted. But he wrote in his notebook:

​		nice

“Come on.  Let’s look around some more,” said Annie.

As Jack started after Annie, he saw something glittering in the tall grass. He reached out and picked it up.==（reached out：伸手）==

A medallion. A gold medallion.

A letter was engraved on the medallion. A fancy M.

“Oh, man. Someone came here before us,” Jack said softly.



## 6：Dinosaur Valley（恐龙山谷）

“Annie, look at this!” Jack called. “Look what I found!”

Annie had gone up to the hilltop.

She was busy picking a flower from the magnolia tree.

“Annie, look! A medallion!”

But Annie wasn’t paying attention to Jack. She was staring at something in the other side of the hill.

“Oh, wow!” she said.

“Annie!”

Clutching her magnolia flower, she took off down the hill.

“Annie, come back!” Jack shouted.

But Annie had disappeared.

“I’m going to kill her,” Jack muttered.

He stuffed the gold medallion into his jeans pocket.

Then he heard Annie shriek.

“Annie?”

Jack heard another sound as well. A deep, bellowing sound. Like a tuba.

“Jack! Come here!” Annie called.

“Annie!”

Jack grabbed his backpack and raced up the hill.

When he got to the top, he gasped.

The valley below was filled with nests. Big nests made out of mud. And the nests were filled with tiny dinosaur.==（were filled：巢穴被堆满了小恐龙）==

Annie was crouching next to one of the nests. And standing over her was a gigantic duck-billed dinosaur!

“Don’t panic. Don’t move,” said Jack. He stepped slowly down the hill toward Annie.

The huge dinosaur was towering above Annie. Waving her arms. Making her tuba sound.

Jack stopped. He didn’t want to get too close.

He knelt on the ground. “Okay. Move toward me. Slowly,” he said.

Annie started to stand up.

“Don’t stand. Crawl,” said Jack.

Clutching her flower, Annie crawled toward Jack.

The duck-billed dinosaur followed her. Still bellowing.

Annie froze.

“Keep going,” Jack said softly.

Annie started crawling again.

Jack inched farther down the hill. Until he was just an arm’s distance from Annie.

He reached out---and grabbed her hand.

He pulled Annie toward him.

“Stay down,” he said. He crouched next to her. “Bow you head. Pretend to chew.”

“Chew?”

“Yes. I read that’s what you do if a mean dog comes at you.”

“She’s no dog Jack,” said Annie.

“Just chew,” said Jack.

Jack and Annie both bowed their heads. And pretended to chew.

Soon the dinosaur grew quiet.==（grew quiet：变得安静）==

Jack raised his head.

“I don’t think she’s mad anymore,” he said.

“Thank, Jack, for saving me” said Annie

“You have to use your brain,” said Jack.

“You can’t just to running to a nest of babies. There’s always a mother nearby.”

Annie stood up.

“Annie!”

 Too late.

Annie held out her magnolia flower to the dinosaur.

“I’m sorry I made you worry about your babies,” she siad.

The dinosaur moved closer to Annie. She grabbed the flower from her. She reached for another.

“No more,” said Annie.

The dinosaur let out a sad tuba there.

“But there are more flowers up there, “Annie said. She pointed to the top of the hill. “I’ll get you some.”

Annie hurried up the hill.

The dinosaur waddled after her.

Jack quickly examined the babies. Some were crawling out of their nests.

Where were the other mothers?

Jack took out the dinosaur book. He flipped through the pages.

He found a picture of some duck-billed dinosaur. He read the caption:

​		The Anatosauruses lived in colonies while a few mothers baby-sat the neats, others hunted for food.

So there must be more mothers close by.

“Hey, Jack!” Annie called.

Jack looked up. Annie was at the top of the hill. Feeding magnolia fowers to the giant Anatosaurus!

“She’s nice, too, Jack,” Annie said.

But suddenly the Anatosaurus made her terrible tuba sound. Annie crouched down and started to chew.

The dinosaur barged down the hill.

She seemed afraid of something.

Jack put the book down on top of his pack. He hurries up to Annie.

 “I wonder why she ran away,” said Annie. “We were starting to be friends.”

Jack looked around. What he saw in the distance almost made him throw up.==(throw up：恶心呕吐)==

An enormous ugly monster was coming across the plain.

He was walking on two big legs. And swinging a long, thick tail. And dangling two tiny arms.

He had a huge head. And his jaws were wide open.

Even from far away Jack could see his long, gleaming teeth.

“Tyrannosaurus rex!” whispered Jack



## 7：Ready, Set, Go!（准备，预备，出发）

“Run, Annie! Run!” cried Jack. “To the tree house!”

They dashed down the hill together. Through the tall grass, through the ferns, past the Pteranodon, and right to the rope ladder.

They scrambled up. Seconds later they tumbled into the tree house.

Annie leaped to the window. 

“He’s going away!” she said, panting.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He looked through the window with her.

The Tyrannosaurus was wandering off.

But then the monster stopped and turned around.

“Duck!” said Jack.

The two of them hunched down.

After a long moment, they raised their heads. They peeked out again.

“Coast clear,” said Jack.

“Yay,” whispered Annie.

“We have to get out of here,” said Jack.

“You made a wish before,” said Annie.

“I wish we could go back to Frog Creek,” said Jack.

Nothing happened.

“I wish--”

“Wait. You were looking at a picture in the dinosaur book. Remenber?”

The dinosaur book.

Jack groaned. “Oh, on. I left the book and my pack on the hill. I have to go back.”

“Oh, forget it,” siad Annie.

“I can’t,” said Jack. “The book doesn’t belong to us. Plus my notebook’s in my pack. With all my notes.”

“Hurry!” said Annie.

Jack hurried down the rope ladder.

He leaped to the ground.

He raced past the Pteranodon, through the ferns, through the tall grass, and up the hill.

He looked down.

There was his pack, lying on the ground. On top of it was the dinosaur book.

But now the vally below was filled with Anatosauruses. All standing guard around the nests.

Where had they been? Did fear of the Tyrannosaurus send them home?

Jack took a deep breath.

Ready! Set! Go!

He charged down the hill. He leaped to his backpack. He scooped it up. He grabbed the dinosaur book.

A terrible tube sound! Another! Another! All the Anatosauruses were bellowing at him.

Jack took off.

He raced up to the hilltop.

He started down the hill.

He stopped.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was back! And he was standing between Jack and the tree house!



## 8：A Giant Shadow（巨大的影子）

Jack jumped behind the magnolia tree.

His heart was beating so fast he could hardly think.

He peeked out at the giant monster. The horrible-looking creature was opening and closing his huge jaws. His teeth were as big as steak knives.

Don’t panic. Think.

Jack peered down at the valley.

Good. The duck-billed dinosaur were sticking close their nests.

Jack looked back at the Tyrannosaurus.

Good. The monster still didn’t seem to know he was there.

Don’t panic. Think. Think. Maybe there’s information in the book.

Jack opened the dinosaur book. He  found Tyrannosaurus rex. He read:

​	Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest meat-eating land animal of all time. If it were alive today, it would eat a human in one bite.

Great. The book was no help at all.

Okay. He couldn’t hide on the other side of the hill. The Anatosauruses might  stampede.

Okay. He couldn’t run to the tree house. The Tyrannosaurus might run faster.

Okay. Maybe he should just wait. Wiat for the monster to leave.

Jack peek around the tree.

The Tyrannosaurus had wandered closer to the hill.

Something caught Jack’s eye. Annie was coming down the rope ladder!

Was she nuts? What was she doing?

Jack watch Annie hop off the ladder.

She went straight to the Pteranodon. She was talking to him. She was flapping her arms. She point at Jack, at the sky, at the tree house.

She was nuts!

“Go! Go back up the tree!” Jack whispered. “Go!”

Suddenly Jack heard a roar.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was looking in his driection.

Jack hit the ground.

The Tyrannosaurus rex was coming toward the hill.

Jack felt the ground shaking.

Should he run? Crawl back into Dinosaur Valley? climb the magnolia tree?

Just then a giant shadow covered Jack. He looked up.

The Pteranodon was gliding overhead. The giant creature sailed down toward the top of the hill.

He was coming straight for Jack.



## 9：The Amazing Ride（神奇之旅）

The Pteranodon coasted down to the ground.

He stared at Jack with his bright, alert eyes.

What was Jack supposed to do? Climb on? “But I’m too heavy,” thought Jack.

Don’t think. Just do it.

Jack looked at the Tyrannosaurus.

He was starting up the hill. His giant teeth were flashing in the sunlight.

Okay. Don’t think. Just do it.

Jack put his book in his pack. Then he eased down onto the Pteranodon’s back.

He held on tightly.

The creature moved forward. He spread out his wings--and lifted off the ground!

They teetered this way. Then that.

Jack nearly fell off.

The Pteranodon steadied himself, then rose into the sky.

Jack looked down. The Tyrannosaurus was chomping the air and staring up at him.

The Pteranodon glided away.

He sailed over the hilltop.

He circle over the calley. Over all the nests filled with babies. Over all the giant duck-billed dinisaurs.

Then the Pteranodon soared out over the plain--over the Triceratops who was grazing in the high grass.

It was amazing! It was a miracle!

Jack felt like a brid. As light as a feather.

The wind was rushing through his hair. The air smelled sweet and fresh.

He whooped. He laughed.

Jack couldn’t believe it. He was riding on the back of an ancient flying reptile.

The Pteranodon sailed over the stream, over the ferns and bushes.

Then he carried Jack down to the base of the ask tree.

When they came to a stop, Jack slid off the creature’s back. And landed on the ground.

Then the Pteranodon took off again and glided into the sky.

“Bye, Henry, ” whispered Jack.

“Are you okay?” Annie shouted from the tree house.

Jack pushed his glaseees into place. He kept staring up at the Pteranodon.

“Jack, are you okay?” Annie called.

Jack looked up at Annie. He smiled.

“Thanks for saving my life,” he said. “That was really fun.”

“Climb up!” said Annie.

Jack tried to stand. His legs were wobbly.

He felt a bit dizzy.

“Hurry!” shouted Annie. “He’s coming!”

Jack looked around. The Tyrannosaurus was heading straight toward him!

Jack bolted to the ladder. He grabbed the sides and started up.

“Hurry! Hurry!” screamed Annie.

Jack scrambled into the tree house.

“He’s coming toward the tree!” Annie cried.

Suddenly something slammed against the oak tree. The tree house shook like leaf.

Jack and Annie tumbled into the books.

“Make a wish!” cried Annie.

“We need the book! The one with the picture of Frog Creek” said Jack. “Where is it?”

He pushed some book aside. he had to find that book about Pennsylvania.

There it was!

He grabbed it and tore through it. looking for the photograph of the Frog Creek woods.

He found it! Jack pointed to the picture.

“I wish we could go home!” he shouted.

The wind began to moan. Softly at frist.

“Hurry!” Jack yelled.

The wind picked up. It was whistling now.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Jack closed his eyes. He held on tightly to Annie.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Home Before Dard（黎明前的家）

A bird began to sing.

Jack opened his eyes. He was still pointing at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

He peeked out the tree house window. Outside he saw the exact same view.

“We’re home,” whispered Annie.

The woods were lit with a golden late-afternoon light. The sun ws about to set.

No time had passed since they’d left.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” a voice called from the distance.

“That’s Mom,” said Annie, pointing.

Jack saw their mother far away. She was standing in front of their house. She looked very tiny.

“An-nie! Ja-ack!” she called. Annie stuck her head out the window and shouted, “Come-ing!”

Jack still felt dazed. He just stared at Annie.

“What happened to us?” he said.

“We took a trip in a magic tree house” said Annie simply.

“But it’s the same time as when we left,” said Jack.

Annie shrugged.

“And how did it take us so far away?” said Jack. “And so long ago?”

“You just looked at a book and said you wished we could go there,” said Annie. “And the magic tree house took us there.”

“But how?” said Jack. “And who built this magic tree house? Who put all these book here?”

“A magic person, I guess,” said Annie.

“A magic person?”

“Oh, look,” said Jack. “I almost forgot about this.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the gold medallion. “Someone lost this back there.... in dinosaur land. Look, there’s a letter M on it.”

Annie’s eyes got round. “You think M stands for magic person?” she said.==（stands for：代表）==

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “I just know someone went to that place before ue.”

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” came the distant cry again.

Annie poked her head out the window. “Come-ing!” she shouted.

Jack put the gold medallion back in his pocket.

He pulled the dinosaur book out of his pack. And out it back with all the other book.

Then he and Annie took one last look around the tree house.

“Good-bye, house,” whispered Annie.

Jack slung his backpack over his shoulder. He pointed at the ladder.

Annie started down. Jack followed.

Seconds later they hopped onto the ground and started walking out of the woods.

“No one’s going to believe out story,” said Jack.

“So let’s not tell anyone,” said Annie.

“Dad won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“He’ll say it was a dream,” said Annie.

“Mom won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“She’ll say it was pretend,” said Annie.

“My teacher won’t believe it,” said Jack.

“She’ll say you’re nuts,” said Annie.

“We better not tell anyone,” said Jack.

“I already said that,” said Annie.

Jack sighed. “I think I’m starting to not believe it myself,” he said.

They left the woods and started up the road toward their house.

As they walked past all the houses on their street,  the trip to dinosaur time did seem more and more like a dream.==（more and more：越来越...）==

Only this world and this time seemed real.

Jack reached into his pocket. He clasped the gold medallion.

He felt the engraving of the letter M. It made Jack’s fingers tingle.

Jack laughed. Suddenly he felt very happy.

He couldn’t explain what had happened today. But he knew for sure that their trip in the magic tree house had been real.

Absolutely real.

“Tomorrow,” Jack said softly, “we’ll go back to the woods.”

“Of course,” said Annie.

“And we’ll climb up to the tree house,” said Jack.

“Of course,” said Annie.

“And we’ll see what happens next,” said Jack.

“Of course,” said Annie. “Race you!”

And they took off together. running gor home.



# The Knight at Dawn（黎明骑士）

## 1：The Dark Woods

Jack couldn’t sleep.

He put his glasses on. He looked at the clock. 5:30.

Too early to get up.

Yesterday so many  strange things has happened. Now he was trying to figure them up.==(figure ... up：弄懂.....)==

He turned on the light. He picked up his notebook. He looked at the list he’d made before going to bed.

​	found tree house in woods

​	found lots of  booksa in it

​	pointed to Pteranodon picture in book

​	made a wish

​	went to time of dinosaurs

​	pointed to picture of Frog Creek woods

​	made a wish

​	came home to frog creek

Jck pushed his glasses into place. Who was going to believe any of this?

Not his Mom. Or his dad. Or his thrid-grade teacher, Ms Watkins. Only his seven-year-old sister, Annie. She’d gone with him to the time of the dinosaurs.

“Can’t you sleep?”

It was Annie, standing in his doorway.

“Nope,” said Jack.

“Me neither,” said Annie. “What are you doing?”

She walked over to Jack and look at his notebook. She read the list.

“Aren’t you going to write about the gold medal?” she asked.

“You mean the gold medallion,” said Jack.

He picked up his pencil and wrote:

​	found this in dinosaur time 🏅

“Aren’t you going to put the letter M on the medal?” said Annie

“medallion,” said Jack. “Not medal.”

He added an M:

​	M

“Aren’t you doing to write about the magic person?” said Annie.

“We don’t know for sure if there is a magic person,” said Jack.

“Well, someone built the tree house in the woods. Someone put the books in it. Someone list a gold medal in dinosaur time.”

“Medallion!” said Jack for the thrid time. “And I’m just write the facts. The stuff we know for sure.”

“Let’s go back to the tree house right now,” said Annie. “And find out if the magic person is a fact.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “The sun’s not even up yet.”

“Come on,” said Annie. “Maybe we can catch them sleeping.”

“I don’t think we should,” said Jack. He was worried. What if he “magic person” was mean? What if he or she didn’t want kids to know about the tree house?

“Well, I’m going,” siad Annie.

Jack looked out his window at the dark-gray sky. It was almost dawn.

He sighed. “Okay, Let’s get dressed. I’ll meet you at the back door. Be quiet.“

“Yay!” whispered Annie. She tiptoed away as quietly as a mouse.

Jack put on jeans, a warm sweatshirt, and sneakers. He tossed his notebook and pencil in his backpack.

He crept downstairs.

Annie was waiting by the back door. She shined a falshlight in Jack’s face. “Ta-da! A magic wand!” she said.

“Shhh! Don’t wake up Mom and Dad,” whispered Jack. “And turn that flashlight off. We don’t want anyone to see us.”

Annie nodded and turned it off. Then she clipped it onto her belt.

They slipped out the door into the cool early-morning air. Crickets were chirping. The dog next door barked==(slipped out：溜走)==

“Quiet, Henry!” whispered Annie.

Henry stopped barking. Animals always seemed to do what Annie said.

“Let’s run!” said Jack.

They dashed across the dark, wet lawn and didn’t stop until they reached the woods.

“We need the flashlight now,” said Jack.

Annie took it off her belt and switched it on.

Step by step, she and Jack walked between the trees. Jack held his breath. The dark woods were scary.

“Gotcha!” said Annie, shining the flashlight in Jack’s face.

Jack jumpped back. Then he frowned.

“Cut it out!” he said.

“I scared you,” said Annie.

Jack glared at her.

“Stop pretending!” he whispered. “This is serious.”

“Okay, okay.”

Annie shined her flashlight over the tops of the trees.

“Now what are you doing?” said Jack.

“Looking for the tree house!”

The light stopped moving.

There it was. The mysterious tree house. At the top of the tallst tree in the woods.

Annie shined her light at the tree house, and then down the tall ladder. All the way to the ground.

“I’m going up,” she said. She gripped the flashlight and began to climb.

“Wait!” Jack called.

What if someone was in the tree house?

“Annie! Come back!”

But she was gone. The light disappeared. Jack was alone in the dark.



## 2：Leaving Again

“No one’s here!” Annie shouted down.

Jack thought about going home. Then he thought about all the books in the tree house.==(thought about：考虑)==

He started up the ladder. When he was nearly to the tree house, he saw light in the distant sky. Dawn was starting to break.

He crawled through a hole in the floor and took off his backpack.

It was dark inside the tree house.

Annie was shining her flashlight on the book scattered about.

“They’re still here,” she said.

she stopped the light on a dinosaur book. It was the book that had taken them to the time of the dinosaurs.

“Remember the Tyrannosaurus?” asked Annie.

Jack shuddered. Of course he remembered! How could anyone forget seeing a real live Tyrannosaurus rex?

The light fell on a book about Pennsylvania. A red silk bookmark stuck out of it.

“Remember the picture of Frog Creek?” said Annie.

“Of course,” said Jack. That was the picture that has brought then home.

“There’s my favorite,” said Annie.

The light was shining on a book about knights and castles. There was a blue leather bookmark in it.

Annie turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a knight on a black horse. He riding toward a castle.

“Annie, close that book.” said Jack. “I know what you’re thinking.”

Annie pointed at the knight.

“Don’t, Annie!”

“We wish we could see this guy for real,” Annie said.

“No, we don’t!” shouted Jack.

They heard a strange sound.

“Neeee-hhhh”

It sounded like a horse neighing.

They both went to the window.

Annie shined the flashlight down on the ground.

“Oh no,” whispered Jack.

“A knight!” said Annie.

A knight in shining armor! Riding a black horse! Through the Frog Creek woods!

Then the wind began to moan. The leaves began to tremble.

It was happening again.

“We’re leaving!” cried Annie. “Get down!”

The wind moaned louder. The leaves shook harder.

And the tree house started tp spin. It spun faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes. He shivered. The air was damp and cool.

The sound of a horse’s whinny came again from below.

“Neee-hhhhh”

“I think we’re here,” whispered Annie. She was still holding the castle book.

Jack peeked out the window.

A huge castle loomed out of the fog.

He looked around. The tree house was in a different oak tree. And down below, the knight on the black horse was riding by. 

“We can’t stay here,” said Jack. “We have to go home and make a plan first.” He picked up the book about Pennsylvania. He opened it to the page with the red silk bookmark. He point to the photograph of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish---”

“No!” said Annie. She yanked the book away from him. “Let’s stay! I want to visit the castle!”

“You’re nuts. We have to examine the situation,” said Jack. “From home.”

“Let’s examine it here!” said Annie.

“Come on.” He held out his hand. “Give it.”

Annie gave Jack the book. “Okay. You can go home. I’m staying,” she said clipped the flashlight to her belt.

“Wait!” said Jack.

“I’m going to take a peek. A teeny peek,” she said. And she scooted down the ladder.

Jack groaned. Okay, she had won. He couldn’t leave without her. Besides, he sort of wanted to take a peek himself.==(sort of：有点儿)==

He put down the book about Pennsylvania.

He dropped the castle book into his pack. He stepped onto the ladder. And headed down into the cool, misty air.



## 3：Across the Bridge

Annie was under the tree, looking across the foggy ground.==(looking across：望向....)==

“The knight’s riding toward that bridge, I think,” said Annie. “The bridge goes to the castle.”

“Wait. I’ll look it up,” said Jack. “Give me the flashlight!”

He took the flashlight from her and pulled the castle book out of his pack. He opened it to the page with the leather bookmark.

He read the words under the picture of the knight:

​	This is knight arriving for a castle feast. Knights wore armor when they traveled long and dangerous distances. The armor was very heavy. A helmet alone could weigh up to forty pounds.

Wow. Jack had weighed forty pounds when he was five years old. So it’d be like riding a horse with a five-year-old on your head.

Jack pulled out his notebook. He wanted to take notes, as he’d done on their dinosaur trip.

He wrote:

​	heavy head

What else?

He turned the pages of the castle book. He found a picture that showed the whole castle and the buildings around it.

“The knight’s crossing the bridge,” said Annie. “He’s going through the gate.... He’s gone.”

Jack studied the bridge in the picture.

He read:

 	A drawbridge crossed the moat. The moat was filled with water, to help protect the castle from enemies.

​	Some People believe crocodiles were kept in the moat.

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​	crocodiles in moat?

“Look!” said Annie, peering through the mist. “A windmill! Right over there!”

“Yeah, there’s a windmill in here, too,” said Jack, pointing at the picture.

“Look at the the real one, Jack,” said Annie. “Not the one in the book.”

A piercing shriek split the air.

“Yiles,” said Annie. “It sounded like it came from that little house over there!” She pointed through the fog.

“There’s a little house here,” said Jack, studying the picture. He turned the page and read:

​	The hawk house was in the inner ward of the castle. Hawks were trained to hunt other birds and small animals.

Jack wrote in his notebook:

 		hawks in hawk house

“We must be in the inner ward,” said Jack.

“Listen!” whispered Annie. “You hear that? Drums! Horns! They’re coming from the castle. Let’s go see.”

“Wait,” said Jack. He turned more pages of the book.

“I want to see what’s really going on, Jack. Not what’s in the book,” said Annie.

“But look at this!” said Jack.

He pointed to a picture of a big praty. Men were standing by the door, playing drums and horns.

He read:

​	Fanfares were played to announce different dishes in a feast. Feasts were held in the Great Hall.

“You can look at the book. I’m going to the real feast,” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack, studying the picture. It showed boys his age carrying trays of food. Whole pigs. Pies. Peacocks with all their feathers. Peacocks?

​	Jack wrote:

​			They eat peacocks?

He held up the book to show Annie. “Look, I think they eat---”

Where was she? Gone. Again.

Jack looked through the fog.

He heard the real drums and the real horns. He saw the real hawk house, the real windmill, the real moat.

He saw Annie dashing across the real drawbridge. Then she vanished through the gate leading to the castle.



## 4：Into the Castle

“I’m going to kill her,” muttered Jack.

He threw his stuff into his pack and moved toward the drawbridge. He hoped on one would see him.

It was getting darker. It must be night.

When he got to the bridge, he started across. The wooden planks creaked under his feet.

He peered over the edge of the bridge. Were there any crocodiles in the moat? He couldn’t tell.

“Halt!” someone shouted. A guard on top of the castle wall was looking down.

Jack dashed across the bridge. He ran through the castle gate and into the courtyard.

From inside the castle came the sounds of music, shouting, and laughter.

Jack hurried to a dark corner and crouched down. He shivered as he look around for Annie.

Torches lit the high wall around the courtward. The courtyard was nearly empty.

Two boys led horses that clopped over the gray cobblestones.

“Neeee-hhhh!”

Jack turned. It was the knight’s black horse!

“Psssst!”

He peered into the darkness.

There was Annie.

She was hiding behind a well in the center of the courtyard. She waved at him.

Jack waved back. He waited till the boys and horses disappeared inside the stable. Then he dashed to the wall.

“I’m going to find he music!” whispered Annie. “Are you comint?”

“Okay,” Jack said with a sigh.

They tiptoed across the cobblestones. Then they slipped into the entrance of the castle.

Noise and music came from a bright room in front of them. They stood on one side of the doorway and peek in.

“The feast in the Great Hall!” whispered Jack. He held his breath as he stared in awe.

A giant fireplace blazed at one end of the noisy room. Antlers and tugs hung on the stone walls. Flowers covered the floor. Boys in short dresses carried huge trays of food.

Dogs were fighting over bones under the tables.

People in bright clothes and funny hats strolled among the crowd. Some played funny-shaped guitars. Some tossed balls in the air. Some balanced swords on their hands.

Men and women dressed in capes and furs sat at long, crowded wooden tables.

“I wonder which one is the knight,” said Jack.

“I don’t know,” whispered Annie. “But they’re eating with their fingers.”

Suddenly, someone shouted behind them.

Jack whirled around.

A man carrying a tray of pies was standing a few feet away.

“Who art thou?” he asked angrily.

“Jack,” squeaked Jack.

“Annie,” squeaked Annie.

Then they ran as fast as they could down a dimly lit hallway.



## 5：Trapped

“Come on!” cried Annie.

Jack raced behind her.

Were they being followed?

“Here! Quick!” Annie dashed toward a door off the hallway. She pushed the door open. The two of them stumbled into a dark, cold room. The door creaked shut behind them.

“Give me the flashlight,” said Annie. Jack handed it to her, and she switch it on.

Yikes! A row of knight right in front of then!

Annie flicked off the light.

Silence.

“They aren’t moving,” Jack whispered.

Annie turned the light back on.

“They’re just suits,” Jack said.

“Without heads,” said Annie.

“Let me have the flashlight a second,” said Jack. “So I can look in the book.”

Annie handed him the flashlight. He pulled out the castle book. He flipped through the pages until the found what he was looking for.

Jack put the book away. “It’s called the armory,” he said. “It’s where armor and weapons are stored.”

He shined the flashlight around the romm.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

The light fell on shiny breastplates, leg plates, arm plates. On shelves filled with helmets  and weapons. On shields, spears, swords, crossbows, clubs, battle-axes.

There was a noise in the hall. Voices!

“Let’s hide!” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I got to check on something first.”

“Hurry,” said Annie.

“It’ll take just a second,” said Jack. “Hold this.” He handed Annie the flashlight.

He tried to lift a helmet from a shelf. It was too heavy.

He bent over and dragged the helmet over his head. The visor slammed shut.

Oh, forget it. It was worse than having a five-year-old on you head.

Not only could Jack not lift his head, he couldn’t see anything, either.

“Jack!” Annie’s voice sounded far away.

“The voices ar getting closer!”

“Turn off the flashlight!” Jack’s voice echoed inside the metal chamber.

He struggled to get the helmet off.

Suddenly he lost his balance and went crashing into other pieces of armor

The metal plates and weapons clattered to the floor.

Jack lay on the floor in the dark.

He tried to get up. But his head was to heavy.

He heard deep voices.

Someone grabbed him by the arm. The next thing he knew, his helmet was yanked off. He was staring into the blazing light of a fiery torch.



## 6：Ta-da

In the torchlight, Jack saw three huge men standing over him.

One with very squinty eyes held the torch. One with a very red face held Jack. And one with a very long mustache held on to Annie.

Annie was kicking and yelling.

“Stop!” said the one with the very long mustache.

“Who art thou?” said the one with the very red face.

“Spies? Foreigners? Egyptians? Romans? Persians?” said the squinty-eyed one.

“No, you dummies!” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” Jack muttered.

“Arrest them!” said Red-face.

“The dungeon!” said Squinty-eyes.

The guards marched Jack and Annie out of the armory.  Jack looked back frantically. Where was his backpack?

“Go!” said a guard, giving him a push.

Jack went.

Down they marched, down the long, dard hallway. Squinty, Annie, Mustache, Jack, and Red.

Down a narrow, winding staircase.

Jack heard Annie shouting at the guards.

“Dummies! Meanies! We didn’t to anything!”

The guards laughed. They didn’t take her seriously at all.

At the bottom of the stairs was a big iron door with a bar across it.

Squinty pushed the bar off the door. Then he shoved at the door. It creaked open.

Jack and Annie were pushed into a cold clammy room.

The fiery torch lit the dungeon. There were chains  hanging from the filthy walls. Water dripped from the ceiling, making puddles on the stone floor. It was the creepiest place Jack had ever seen.

“We’ll keep them here till the feast is done. Then turn them over to the Duke,” said Squinty. “He knows how to take care of thieves.”

“There will be a hanging tomorrow,” said Mustache.

“If the rats don’t get them first,” said Red.

They all laughed.

Jack saw that Annie had his backpack. She was quietly unzipping it.

“Come on, let’s chain the two of’em,” said Squinty.

The guards started toward them. Annie whipped her flashlight out of the pack.

“Ta-da!” she yelled.

The guards froze. They stared at the shiny flashlight in her hand.

Annie switch the light on. The grards gasped in fear. They jumped back against the wall.

Squinty dropped the torch. It fell into a dirty puddle on th floor, sputtered, and went out.

“My magic wand!” Annie said, waving the flashlight. “Get down. Ot I’ll wipe you out!”

Jack’s mouth dropped open.

Annie fiercely pointed her light at one, then the other. Each howled and covered his face.

“Down! All of you! Get down!” shouted Annie

One by one, the grards lay down on the  wet floor.

Jack couldn’t believe it.

“Cone on,” Annie said to him. “Let’s go.”

Jack looked at the open doorway. He looked at the guards quaking on the ground.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

In one quick leap, Jack followed her out of the terrible dungeon.



## 7：A Secret Passage

Annie and Jack raced back up the winding stairs and down the long hallway.

They hadn’t gone far when they heard shouting behind them.

Dogs barked in the distance.

“They’re coming!” Annie cried.

“In here!” said Jack. He shoved open a door off the hallway and pulled Annie into a dark room.

Jack pushed the door shut. Then Annie shined her flashlight around the room. There were rows of sacks and wooded barrels.

“I’d better look in the book,” said Jack. “Give it to me!”

Annie gave him the flashlight and his backpack. He pulled out the book and started tearing through it.

“Shhh!” said Annie. “Someone’s coming.”

Jack and Annie jumped behind the door as it creaked open.

Jack held his breath. A light from a torch danced wildly over the sacks and barrels.

The light disappeared. The door slammed shut.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We have to hurry. They might come back.”

His hands were trembling as he flipped through the pages of the castle book.

“Here’s a map of the castle,” he said. “Look, this must be the room we’re in. It’s a storeroom.” Jack studied the room in the book.

“These are sacks of flour and barrels of wine.”

“Who cares? We have to go!” said Annie. “Before they come back!”

“No. Look,” said Jack. He pointed at the map. “Here’s a trapdoor.”

He read aloud:

​		This door leads from the storeroom through a secret passage to a precipice over the moat.

“What’s a precipice?” said Annie.

“I don’t know. We’ll find out,” said Jack. “But frist we have to find the door.”

Jack looked at the picture carefully. Then he shined the flashlight around the room.

The floor of the room was made up of stones. The trapdoor in the picture was five stons away from the door to the hall. 

Jack shined the light on the floor and counted the stones. “One, two, three, four, five.”

He stamped on the fifth stone. It was loose.

He put the flashlight on the floor. He worked his fingers under the thin sheet of stone and tried to lift it.

“Help,” Jack said.

Annie came over and helped him lift the stone square out of its place. Underneath was a small wooden door.

Jack and Annie tugged on the rope handle of the door. The door fell open with a thunk.

Jack picked up the flashlight and shined it on the hole.

“There’s a little ladder,” he said. “Let’s go!”

He clipped on the flashlight and felt his way down the small ladder. Annie follweed.

When they both reached the bottom of the ladder, Jack shined the light around them.

There was a tunnel!

He crouched down and began moving through the damp, creepy tunnel. The flashlight barely lit the stone walls.

He shook the light. Were the batteries running down?

“I think our light’s dying!” he said to Annie.

“Hurry!” she called from behind.

Jack went faster. His back hurt from crouching.

The light got dimmer and dimmer.

He was desperate to get out of the castle before the batteries died completely.

Soon he reached another samll wooden door. The door at the end of  the tunnel!

Jack unlatched the door and pushed it open. He poked his head outside.

He couldn’t see anything in the misty drakness.

The air felt good. Cool and fresh. He took a deep breath.

“Where are we?” whispered Annie behind him. “What do you see?”

“Nothing. But I think we’ve come to the ouside of the castle,” said Jack. “I’ll find out.”

Jack put the flashlight in his pack. He put the pack on his back. He stuck his hand out the door. He could’t feel the ground. Just air.

“I’m going to have to go feet first,” he said.

Jack turned around in the samll tunnel. He lay down on his stomach. He stuck one leg out the door. Then the other.

Jack inched down, bit by bit. Until he was hanging out the foor, clinging to the ledge.

“This must be the precipice!” he called to Annie. “Pull me up!”

Annie reached for Jack’s hands. “I can’t hold you!” she said.

Jack felt his fingers slipping. Then down he fell.

SPLASH!

##  8：The knight

Water filled Jack’s nose and coverd his head.

His glasses fell off. He grabbed them just in time. He coughed and flailed his arms.

“Jack!” Annie was calling from above.

“I’m in... the moat!” said Jack, gasping for air. He tried to tread water and put his glasses back on. With his backpack, his shoes, and his heavy clothers, he could hardly stay afloat.

SPLASH!

“Hi! I’m here!” Annie sputtered.

Jack could hear her nearby. But he couldn’t see her.

“Which way’s land?” Annie asked.

“I don’t know! Just swim!”

Jack dog-paddled through the cold black water.

He heard Annie swimming, too. At frist it seemed as if she was swimming in front of him. But then he heard a splash behind him.

“Annie?” he called.

“What?” Her voice came from in front. Not behind.

 Another splash. Behind.

Jack’s heart almost stopped. Crocodiles? He couldn’t see anything through his water-streaked glasses.

“Annie!” he whispered.

“What”

“Swim faster!”

“But I’m here! I’m over here! Near the edge!” she whispered.

Jack swam through the dark toward her voice. He imagined a crocodile slithering after him.

Another splash! Not far away!

Jack’s hand touched a wet, live thing.

“Ahhhh!” he cried.

“It’s me! Take my hand!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed her hand. She pulled him to the edge of the moat. They crawled over an embankment onto the wet grass.

Safe!

Another splash came from the  moat water.

“Oh, man,” Jack said.

He was shivering all over. His teeth were chattering. He shook the water off his glasses and put then back on.

 It was so misty the couldn’t see the castle. He couldn’t even see the moat, much less a crocodile.

“We.... we made it,” said Annie. Her teeth were chattering, too.

“I know,” said Jack. “But where are we?” He peered at the foggy darkness.

Where was the drawbridge? The windmill? The hawk house? The grove of trees? The tree house?

Everything had been swallowed up by the thick, soupy darkness.

Jack reached into his wet backpack and pulled out the flashlight. He pushed the switch. No more light.

They were trapped. Not in a dungeon, But in the still, cold drakness.

“Neee-hhhh!”

A horse’s whinny.

Just then the coulds parted. A full moon was shining in the sky. A pool of light spread through the mist.

Then Jack and Annie saw him just a few feet away. The knight.

He sat on the black horse. His armor shone in the moonlight. A visor hid his face. But he seemed to be staring straight at Jack and Annie.



## 9：Under the Moon

Jack froze.

“It’s him,” Annie whispered.

The knight held out his gloved hand.

“Come on, Jack,” Annie said.

“Where are you going?” said Jack.

“He wants to help us,” said Annie.

“How do you know?”

“I can just tell,” said Annie.

Annie stepped toward the horse. The knight dismounted.

The knight pickd Annie up and put her on the back of his horse.

“Come on, Jack,” she called.

Jack moved slowly toward the knight, It was like a dream.

The knight picked him up, too. He placed Jack on the horse, behind Annie.

The knight got on behind them. He slapped the reins.

The black horse cantered beside the moonlit water of the moat.

Jack rocked back and forth in the saddle. The wind blew his hair. He felt very brave and very powerful.

He felt as if he could ride forever on this horse, with this mysterious knight. Over the ocean. Over the world. Over the Moon.

A hawk shrieked in the dardness.

“There’s the tree house,” said Annie. She pointed toward a grove of trees.

The knight steered the horse toward the trees.

“See. There it is,” Annie said, pointing to the ladder.

The knight brought his horse to a stop. He dismounted and helped Annie down.

“Thank you, sir,” she said. And she bowed.

Then Jack. “Thank you,” he said. And he bowed also.

The knight got back on his horse. he raised his gloved hand. Then he slapped the reins and rode off through the mist.

Annie started up the tall ladder, and Jack followed. They climbed into the dark tree house and looked out the window.

The knight was riding toward the outer wall. They saw him go through the outer gate.

Clouds started to cover the moon again. For a brief moment, Jack thought the saw the knight’s armor gleaming on the top of a hill beyond the castle.

The clouds covered the moon completely. And a black mist swallowed the land.

“He’s gone,” whispered Annie.

Jack shivered in his wet clothes as the kept staring at the blackness.

“I’m cold,” said Annie. “Where’s the pennsylvania book?”

Jack heard Annie fumble in the blackness. He kept looking out the window.

“I think this is it,” said Annie. “I feel a silk bookmark.”

Jack was only half-lestening. He was hoping to see the knight’s armor gleam again in the distance.

“Okay. I’m going to use this,” said Annie. “Because I think it’s the right one.. Here goes. Okay. I’m pointing. I’m going to wish we could go to Frog Creek!”

Jack heard the wind begin to blow. Softly at first.

“I hope I pointed to the right picture in the right book, “ said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked back at her. “Right picture? RIght book?”

The tree house began to rock. The wind got louder and louder.

“I hope it wasn’t the dinosaur book!” said Annie.

“Stop!” Jack shouted at the tree house.

Too late.

The tree house started to spin. It was spinning and spinning!

The wind was screaming.

Then suddenly there was silence.

Absolute silence.



## 10：One Mystery Solved

The air was warm.

It was dawn. Far away a dog barked.

“I think that’s Henry barking!” Annie said. “We did come home,”

They both looked out the tree house window.

“That was close,” said Jack.

In the distance, streetlight lit their street. There was a light on in their upstairs window.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “I think Mom and Dad are up. Hurry!”

“Wait.” In a daze, Jack unzipped his backpack. He pulled out the castle book. It was quite wet. But Jack placed it back with all the other books.

“Come on! Hurry!” said Annie, scooting out of the tree house.

Jack followed her down the ladder.

Jack reached the ground and took off between the gray-black trees.

They left the woods and ran down their deserted street.

They got to their yard and crept across the lawn. Right up to the back door.

Jack and Annie slipped inside the house.

“They’re not downstairs yet,” whispered Annie.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

He led the way up stairs and down the hall. No sign of his mom or dad. But he could hear water running in the bathroom.

Their house was so different from the dark, cold castle. So safe and cozy and friendly.

Annie stopped at her bedroom door. She gave Jack a smile, then disappeared inside her room.

Jack hurry into his room. He took off his damp clothes and pulled on his dry, soft pajamas.

He sat down on his bed and unzipped his backpack. He took out his wet notebook. He felt around for the pencil, but his hand touched something else.

Jack pulled the blue leather bookmark out of his pack. It must have fallen out of the castle castle book.

Jack held the bookmark close to his lamp and studied it. The leather was smooth and worn. It seemed ancient.

For the first time the Jack noticed a letter on the bookmark. A fancy M.

Jack opened the drawer next to his bed. He took out the gold medallion.

He looked at the letter on it. It was the same M.

Now this was an amazing new fact.

Jack took a deep breath. One mystery solved.

The person who had dropped the gold medallion in time  of the dinosaurs was the same person who owned all the books in the tree house.

Who was this person?

Jack placed the bookmark next to the medallion. He close the drawer.

He picked up his pencil. He turned to the least wet page in his notebook. And he started to write down this new fact.

​		the same

But before he could draw the M, his eyes closed.

He dreamed they were with the knight again. All three of them riding the black horse through the cool, dark night. Beyond the outer wall of the castle. And up over a moonlit hill.

Into the mist.





# Mummies in the Morning

## 1：Meow!

“It’s still here,” said Jack.

“It books empty,” said Annie.

Jack and his seven-year-old sister gazed up at a very tall oak tree. At the top of the tree was a tree house.

Late-morning sunlight lit the woods. it was almost time for lunch.

“Shhh!” said Jack. “What was that noise?”

“What niuse?”

“I heard a noise,” Jack said. He looked around. “It sounded like someone coughing.”

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Annie. “Come on, Let’s go up.”

She grabbed onto the rope ladder and start climbing.

Jck tiptoed over to a clump of bushes. He pushed aside a small branch.

“Hello?” he said. “Anybody there?”

There was no answer.

“Come on!” Annie called down. “The tree house looks the same as it did yesterday.”

Jack still felt that someone was nearly. Could it be the person who’d put all the books in the tree house?

“Ja-ack!”

Jack gazed over the top of the bushes.

Was the mysterious person watching him now? The person whose name began with M?

Maybe M wanted the gold medallion back. The one Jack had found on their dinosaur adventure. Maybe M wanted the leather bookmark back. The one from the castle book.

There was an M on the medallion. And an M on the bookmark. But what did M stand for?

“Tomorrow I’ll bring everything back,” Jack said loudly.

A breeze swept through the wood. The leaves rattled.

“Come on” call Annie.

Jack went back to the big oak tree. He grabbed onto the rope ladder and climbed up.

At the top he crawed through a hole in the wooden floor. He tossed down his backpack and his glasses into place.

“Hmmmm. Which book is it going to be today?” said Annie.

She was looking at the books scattered around the tree house.

Annie pick up the book about castles.

“Hey, this isn’t wet anymore,” she said.

“Let me see.”

Jack took the book from her. He was amazed. It looked fine. Yesterday it had gotten soaked in a castle moat.

The castle book had taken Jack and Annie back to the time of knights.

Jack silently thanked the mysterious knight who had rescued them.

“Watch out!” warned Annie.

She waved a dinosaur book in Jack’s face.

“Put that away,” said Jack.

The day before yesterday the dinosaur book had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

Jack silently thanked the Pteranodon who had saved him from a Tyrannosaurus rex.

Annie put the dinosaur book back with the other books. Then she gasped.

“Wow,” she whispered. “Look at this.”

She held up a book about ancient Egypt.

Jack caught his breath. He took the book from her. A green silk bookmark stuck out of it.

Jack turned to the page with the bookmark. There was a picture of a pyramid.

Going toward the pyramid was a long parade. Four huge cows with horns were pulling a sled. On the sled was a long gold box. Many Egyptians  were walking behind the sled. At the end of the parade was a sleek black cat.

“Let’s go there,” whispered Annie. “Now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. He wanted to study the book a bit more.

“Pyramids, Jack,” said Annie. “You love pyramids.”

It was ture. Pyramids were high on his list of favorite things. After knight. But before dinosaurs. Way before dinosaurs.

He didn’t have to worry about being eaten by a pyramid.

“Okay,” he said. “But hold the Pennsylvania book. In case we want to come right back here.”

Annie found the book with the picture of their hometown in it. Frog Creek, Pennsylvania

Then Jack pointed to the pyramid picture in the Egypt book. He cleared his throat and said, “I wish we could go to this place.”

“Meow!”

“What was that?” Jack looked out the tree house window.

A black cat was perched on a branch.

Right outside the window. The cat was staring at Jack and Annie.

It was the strangest cat Jack had ever seen. He was very sleek and dark. With bright yellow eyes. And a wide gold collar.

“It’s the cat in the Egypt book,” whispered Annie.

Just then the wind started to blow. The leaves began to shake.

“Here we go!” cried Annie.

The wind whispered louder. The leaves shook harder.

Jack closed his eyes as the tree house started to spin.

It spin faster and faster! And faster!

Suddenly everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Not a sound, Not a whisper.

Jack opened his eyes.

Hot bright sunlight nearly blinded him.

“Me-ow!”



## 2：Oh，Man. Mummies!

Jack and Annie looked out the window.

The tree house was perched on the top of a palm tree. The tree stood with other palm tree. A patch of green surrounded by a sandy desert.

“Meow!”

Jack and Annie looked down.

The black cat was sitting at the base of the tree. His yellow eyes were staring up at Jack and Annie.

“Hi!” Annie shouted.

“Shhh,” said Jack. “Someone might hear you.”

“In the middle of the desert?” said Annie.

The black cat stood and began walking around the tree.

“Come back!” Annie called. She leaned out the window to see where the cat was going.

“Oh, wow!” she said. “Look, Jack.”

Jack leaned forward and looked down.

The cat was running away from the palm tree. Towaod a giant pyramid in the desert.

A parade was going toward the pyramid. The same parade as in the Egypt book.

“It’s the picture from the book!” said Jack.

“What are those people doing?” asked Annie.

Jack looked down at the Egypt book. He read the words under the picture:

​		When a royal person died, a grand funeral procession took place. Family, servants, and mourners followed the coffin. The coffin was called a sarcophagus. It was pulled on a sled by four oxen.

“It’s an Egypttian funeral,” said Jack. “The box is called a sar...sar...sar...oh, forget it.”

He looked out the window again.

Oxen, sled, Egyptians, black cat. All were moving in a slow, dreamy way.

“I’d better make some notes about this,” said Jack.

He reached into his backpack and pulled out his booknote. Jack always kept notes.

“Wait,” said Jack. And he wrote:

​			Coffin called sarcophagus

“We’d better hurry,” said Annie, “if we want to see the mummy.”

She started down the rope ladder.

Jack looked up from his notebook.

“Mummy?” he said.

“There’s probably a mummy in that gold box.” Annie called up. “We’re in ancient Egypt. Remember?”

Jack loved mummies. He put down his pencil.

“Good-bye, Jack!” called Annie.

“Wait!” Jack called.

“Mummies!” Annie shouted.

“Oh, man,” said Jack weakly. “Mummies!” She sure knew to get to him.

Jack shoved his notebook and the Egypt book onto his pack. Then he started down the ladder.

When he got to the ground, he and Annie took off across the sand.

But as they ran a strange thing happened.

The closer they got to the parade, the harder it was to see it.

Then suddenly it was gone. The strange parade had disappeared. Vanished.

But the great stone pyramid was still trere. Towering above them.

Panting, Jack looked around.

What had happened? Where were the people? The oxen? The gold box? The cat?

“They’re gone,” said Annie.

“Where did they go?” said Jack.

“Maybe they were ghosts,” said Annie.

“Don’t be silly. There’s no such thing as ghosts,” said Jack. “It must have been mirage.”

“A what?”

“Mirage. It happens in the desert all the time,” said Jack. “It looks like sonething’s there. But it just turns out to be the sunlight reflecting through heat.”

“How could sunlight look like people, a mummy box, and a bunch of cows?” said Annie.

Jack frowned.

“Ghosts,” she said.

“No way,” said Jack.

“Look!” Annie pointed at the pyramid. Near the back was the sleek black cat.

He was standing alone. He was staring at Jack and Annie.

“He’s no mirage,” said Annie.

The cat started to slink away. He walked along the base of the pyramid and slid around a corner.

“Where’s he going?” said Jack.

“Let’s find out,” said Annie.

They dashed around the corner——just in time to see the cat disappear through a hole in the pyramid.



3：It’s Alive!

“Where did he go?” said Jack.

He and Annie peeked through the hole.

They saw a long hallway. Burning torches lit the walls. Dark shadows loomed.

“Let’s go in,” said Annie.

“Wait,” said Jack.

He pulled out the Egypt book and turned to the section on pyramids.

He read the caption aloud:

​	Pyramids were sometimes called Houses of the Dead.. They were nearly all solid stone, except for the burial 	chambers deep inside.

“Wow. Let’s go there. To the burial chambers,” said Annie. “I bet a mummy’s there.”

Jack took a deep breath.

Then he stepped out of the hot, bright sunlight into the cool, dark pyramid.

The hallway was silent.

Floor, ceiling, walls-everything was stone.

The floor slanted up from where they stood.

“We have to go farther inside,” said Annie.

“Right, ” said Jack. “But stay close behind me. Don’t talk. Don’t——”

“Go! Just go!” said Annie. She gave him a little push.

Jack started up the slanting floor of the hallway.

Where was the cat?

The hallway went on and on.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I want to look at the book.”

He opened the Egypt book again. He held it below a torch on the wall. The book showed a picture of  the insede of the pyramid.

“The burial chamber is in the middle of the pyramid. See?” Jack said. he pointed to the picture. “It seem to be straight ahead.”

Jack tucked the book under his arm. Then they headed deeper into the pyramid.

Soon the floor became flat. The air felt different. Musty and stale.

Jack opened the book again. “I think we’re almost at the burila chamber. See the picture? The hallway slants up. Then it gets flat. Then you come to the chamber. See, look——”

“Eee-eee!” A strange cry shot through the pytamid.

Jack dropped the Egypy book.

Out of the shadows flew a white figure.



## 4：Back from the Dead

Jack pulled Annie down.

The white figure moved swiftly past them. Then disappeared into the shadows.

“A mummy,” said Annie. “Back from the dead!”

“F-forget it,” stammered Jack. “Mummies aren’t alive.” He picked up the Egypt book.

“What’s this?” said Annie. She lifted something from the floor. “Look. The mummy dropped this thing.”

It was a gold stick. About a foot long. A dog’s head was carved on one end.

“It looks like a scepter,” said Jack.

“What’s that?” asked Annie.

“It’s a thing kings and queen carry,” said Jack. “It means they have power over the people.”

“Come back, mummy!” Annie called. “We found you scepter. Come back! We want to help you!”

“Shush!” said Jack. “Are you nuts?”

“But the mummy——”

“That was no mummy,” said Jack. “It was a person. A real person.”

“That kind of person would be inside a pytamid?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book can help us.”

He flipped through the book. At last he found a picture of a person in a pyramid. He read:

​		Tomb robbers often carried off the treasure buried with mummies. False passages were sometimes built 		to stop the robbers.

Jack  closed the book.

“No live mummy,” he said. “Just a tomb robber.”

“Yikes. A tomb robber?” said Annie.

“Yeah, a robber who steals stuff from tombs.”

“But what if the robber comes back,” said Annie. “We’d beeter beave.”

“Right,” said Jack. “But frist I want to write something down.”

He put the Egypt book into his pack. He pulled out his notebook and pencil:

​		tomb robber

“Jack——“ said Annie.”

“Just a second,” said Jack. He kept writing:

​		tomb robber tred to steal

“Jack! Look!” said Annie.

Jack felt a whoosh of cold air. He looked up. A wave of terror went through him.

Another figure was moving slowly toward them.

It wasn’t a tomb robber.

No. It was a lady. A beautiful Egyptian lady.

She wore flowers in her black hair. Her long white dress had many tiny pleats. Her gold jewelry glittered.

“Here, Jack,” Annie whispered. “Give her this.” She handed him the gold scepter.

The lady stopped in front of then.

Jack held out the scepter. His hand was trembling.

He gasped. The scepter passed right through the lady’s hand.

She was made of air.



##  5：The Ghost-Queen

“A ghost,” Annie whispered.

But Jack could only stare in horror.

The ghost began to speak. She spoke in a hollow, echoing vioce.

“I am Hutepi,” she said. “Queen of the Nile. Is it true that you have come to help me?”

“Yes, said Annie.”

Jack still couldn’t speak.

“For a thousand years,” siad the ghost-queen, “I have waited for help.”

Jack’s heart was pounding so hard he thought he might faint.

“Someone must find my book of the Dead,” she said. “I need it to go on to the Next Life.”

“Why do you need the Book of the Dead?” asked Annie. She didn’t sound scared at all.

“It will tell me the magic spells I need to get through the Underworld,” said the ghost-queen.

“The Underworld?” said Annie.

“Before I journey on to the Next Life, I must pass through the horrors of the Underworld.”

“What kinds of horrors?” Annie asked.

“Poisonous snakes,” said the ghost-queen. “Lakes of fire. Monsters. Demons.”

“Oh.” Annie stopped closer to Jack.

“My brother hid the Book of the Dead. So tomb robbers would not steal it,” said the ghost-queen. “Then he carved this secret message on the wall, telling me how to find it.”

She pointed to the wall.

Jack was still in shock. He couldn’t move.

“Where?” asked Annie. “Here?” She squinted at the wall. “ What do these thiy pictures mean?”

The gohst-queen smiled sadly. “Alsa, my brother forgot my strange problem. I cannot see clearly that which is close to my eyes. I have out been able to read his message for a thousand years.”

“Oh, that’s not a strange problem,” said Annie. “Jack can’t see anything either.  That’s why he wears glasses.“

The ghost-queen stared in wonder at Jack.

“Jack, lend her your glasses,” said Annie.

Jack took his glasses off his nose. He held them out the ghost-queen.

She backed away from him. “I fear I cannot wear your glasses, Jack,” she said. “ I am made of air.”

“Oh. O forget,” said Annie.

“But perhaps you will describe the hieroglyphs on these walls” said the ghost-queen.

“Hi-row-who?” said Annie.

“Hieroglyphs!” said Jack, finally finding his voice. “It’s the ancient Egyptian way of writing. It’s like writing with picture.”

The ghost-queen smiled at him. “Thank you, Jack,” she said.

Jack smiled back at her. He put his glasses on. Then he step toward wall and took a good long look.

“Oh,man,” he whispered.    



## 6：The Writing on the Wall

Jack and Annie squinted at the pyramid wall.

A series of tiny pictures were carved into the stone

​		象形文字

“There are four pictures here,” Jack told the ghost-queen.

“Describe them to me, Jack. One at a time, please,” she said.

Jack studied the frist picture.

“Okay,” he said. “The frist one is like this.” He made a zigzag in the air with his finger.

“Like stairs?” asked the ghost-queen.

“Yes,stairs!” said Jack. “Just like stairs.”

She nodded.

Easy enough.

Jack studied the second picture.

​		象形文字

“The second one has a long box one the bottom,” he said. He drew it in the air.

The ghost-queen looked puzzled.

“With three things on top. Like this,” said Annie. She drew squiggly lines in the air.

The ghost-quuen still seem puzzled.

“Like a hat,” said Jack.

“Hat?”said the ghost-queen.

“No. More like a boat,” said Annie.

“Boat?” said the ghost-queen. She got excited. “Boat?”

Jack took another look at the wall.

“Yes. It could be a boat,” he said.

The ghost-queen looked very happy. She smiled.

“Yes. Of course,” she said.

Jack and Annie studied the next picture.

​		象形文字

“The third one is like a thing that holds flowers,” said Annie.

“Or a thing that holds water,” said Jack.

“Like a jug?” asked the ghost-queen.

“Exactly,” said Jack.

“Yes. A jug,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie studied the last picture.

​		象形文字

”And the last one looks like a pole that droops,” said Annie.

“Like a curved stick,” said Jack. “But one side is shorter than the other.”

The ghost-queen looked puzzled.

“Wait,” said Jack. “I’ll draw it in my notebook. Big! So you can see it.”

Jack put down the scepter and got out his pencil. He drew the hieroglyph.

“A folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.

“Well, not really,” said Jack. He studied his drawing.

“But that is the hieroglyph for a folded cloth,” said the ghost-queen.

“Well, okay,” said Jack. 

He looked at the fourth hieroglyph again. He still couldn’t see the folded cloth. Unless it was like a towel hanging over a bathroom rod.

“So that’s all of them,” said Annie. She pointed at each picture. “Stairs, Boat. Jug. Folded cloth.”

Jack wrote the words in his notebook.

​	stairs = 楼梯				Jug = 壶

​	boat = 船						cloth = 布

“So what does the message mean?” he asked the ghost-queen.

“Come,” she said. She held out her hand. “Come to my burial chambers.”

And she floated away.



## 7：The Scroll

Jack put the scepter and his notebook and pencil into his pack.

He and Annie followed the ghost-queen. Deeper into the pyramid. Until they came to some stairs.

“The STAIRA!” said Jack and Annie.

The ghost-queen floated up the stairs.

Jack and Annie followed.

The ghost-queen floated right through a wooden door.

Jack and Annie pushed on the door. It opened slowly.

They stepped into a cold, drafty room.

The ghost-quuen was nowhere is sight.==（nowhere sight:无处可见）==

Dim torchlight lit the huge room. It had a very high ceiling. On one side was a pile of tables, chairs, and musical instruments.

On the other side of the room was a small wooden boat.

“The BOAT!” said Jack.

“What’s it doing inside Queen Hutepi’s pyramid?” asked Annie.

“Myybe it’s supposed to carry her to the Next Life,” said Jack.

He and Annie went over to the boat. They looked insede it.

The boat was filled with many things. Gold plates. Painted cups. Jeweled goblets. Woven backets. Jewelry with blue stones. Small wooden statues.

“Look!” said Jack.

He reached into the boat and lifted out a clay jug.

“The JUG!” said Annie.

Jack looked inside the jug.

“Sonething’s in here,” he said.

“What is it?” asked Annie.

Jack felt down inside the jug.

“It feels  like a big napkin,” he said.

“The FOLDED CLOTH!” said Annie.

Jack reached into the jug and pulled out the folded cloth. It was wrapped around an ancient-looked scroll.

Jack slowly unrolled the scroll.

It was covered with wonderful hieroglyphs.

“The Book of the Dead!” whispered Annie. “We found it. We found her book.”

“Oh, man.” Jack traced his finger over the scroll. It felt like very old paper.

“Queen Hutepi!” called Annie. “We have it! We found your Book of the Dead!”

Silence.

“Queen Hutepi!”

Then another door on the other side of the chamber creaked open.

“In there,” said Annie. “Maybe she’s in there.”

Jack’s heart was pounding. Cold air was coming through the open doorway.

“Come on,” said Annie.

“Wait——”

“No,” said Annie. “She’s waited a thousand years for her book. Don’t make her wait amymore.”

Jack put the ancient scroll into his backpack. Then he and Annie slowly started to cross the drafty room.

They came to the open door. Annie went through first.

“Hurry, Jack!” she said.

Jack stepped into the other room.

It was nearly bare. Except for a long gold box. The box was open. The cover was on the floor.

“Queen Hutepi?” called Annie.

Silence.

“We found it,” said Annie. “Your book of the Dead.”

There was still on sign of the ghost-queen.

The gold box glowed.

Jack could barely breathe. “Let’s leave the scroll on the floor. And go,” he said.

“No. I think we should leave it in there,” said Annie. She pointed to the gold box.

“No,” said Jack.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. “Come on,” Annie took Jack by the arm. They walked together. Across the room. To the glowing gold box.

They stopped in front of the box. And they peered insede.





## 8：The Mummy

A real mummy.

Bandages were still wrapped around the bald skull. But most of the bandages had come off the face.

It was Hutepi. Queen of the Nile.

Her broken teeth were showing. Her little wrinkled ears. Her squashed nose. Her withered flesh. Her hollow eye sockets.

Plus the rotting bandages on her body were coming off. You could see bones.

“Oh, gross!” cried Annie. “Let’s go!”

“No,” said Jack. “It’s interesting.”

“Forget it!” said Annie. She started out of the room.

“Wait, Annie.”

“Come on, Jack. Hurry!” cried Annie. She was standing by the door.

Jack pulled out the Egyph book and flipped to a picture of mummy. He read aloud:

​		Ancient Egyptians tried to protect the body so it would last forever. First it was dried out with salt

“Ugh, stop!” said Annie.

“Listen,” said Jack. He kept reading:

​		Next it was coved with oil. Then it was wrapped tightly in bandages. The brain was removed by-

“Yuck! Stop!” cried Annie. “Good-bye!”

She dashed out of the room.

“Annie!” called Jack. “We have to give her the Book of the Dead!”

But Annie was gone.

Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the scroll and the scepter. He put them next to the mummy’s skull.

Was it just his imagination? Or did a deep sigh seem to shudder throughout the room? Did the mummy’s face grow calmer?

Jack held his breath as he backed away.

Out of the mummy room. Out of the boat room. Down the stairs.

At the bottom of the stairs, he heaved his own sigh. A sigh of relief.

He looked down the hallway. It was empty.

“Hey! Where are you?” he said.

No answer.

Where in the world was Annie?

Jack start down the hallway.

“Annie!” he called.

Had she run out of the pyramid? Was she already outside?

“Annie!”

“Help, Jack!” came a cry. The voice sounded far away.

It was Annie! Where was she?

“Help Jack!”

“Annie!”

Jack started to run. Along the shadowy hallway.

“Help, Jack!” Her cry seemed fainter.

Jack stopped.

He was running away from her voice.

“Annie!” he called. He went back toward the burial chambers.

“Jack!”

There! Her voice was louder.

“Jack!”

Even louder!

Jack climbed the stairs. He went back into the boat room.

He looked around the room. At the furniture The musical instruments. The boat.

Then he saw it. Another door! Right next to the door he had just come through.

The other door was open.

Jack dashed through it. He found himself at the top of some stairs.

They were just like the stairs in the other hallway.

He went down into the hallway. It was lit be torches on the wall.

It was just like the other hallway.

“Annie!” he called.

“Jack!”

“Annie!”

“Jack!”

She was running through the hallway toward him.

She crashed into him.

“I was lost!” she cried.

“I think this is one of those false passages. Built to fool the tomb rabbers,” said Jack.

“A false passage?” said Annie, panting.

“Yeah, it looks just like the right hallway,” said Jack. “We have to go back into the boat room. And out the right door.”

Just then they heard a creaking noise.

Jack and Annie turned around. They looked up the stairs.

Then they watched in horror as the door slowly creaked shut.

A deep sound rumbled in the distance. And all the torches went out.   



## 9：Follow the Leader

It was pitch dark.

“What happened?” asked Annie.

“I don’t know. Something weird,” said Jack. “We have to get out of here fast. Push against the door.”

“Good idea,” said Annie in a small voice.

“They felt their way through the darkness. To the top of the strairs.”

“Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay,” said Jack. He was trying to stay calm.

“Of course,” said Annie.

They leaned against the wooden door and pushed.

 It wouldn’t budge.

They pushed harder.

No use.

Jack took a deep breath. It was getting harder to breathe. And harder to stay calm.

“What can we do?” asked Annie.

“Just...just rest a moment,” said Jack. panting.

His heart was pounding as he tried to see through the darkness.

“Maybe we should start down the hall,” he said. “Maybe we’ll eventually come to...to an exit.”

He wasn’t sure about that. But they had no choice.

“Come on,” he said. “Feel the wall.”

Jack felt the stone wall as he climbed slowly down the stairs. Annie followed.

Jack started down he dark hallway. It was impossible to see anything.

But he kept going. Taking one step at a time. Moving his hands along the wall.

He went around a corner. He went around another corner. He came to some stairs. He went up.

There was a door. He pushed against it. Annie pushed too. This door wouldn’t budge either.

Was this the same door they had started at.

It was no use. They were trapped.

Annie took his hand in the dark. She squeezed it.

They stood together at the top of the stairs.. Listening to the silence.

“Meow”

“Oh, man,” Jack whispered.

“He’s back! said Annie.”

“Meow.”

“Follow him!” cried Jack. “He’s going away from us.”

They start down the dard hallway. Following the cat’s meow.

Hand against the wall, Jack and Annie stumbled through the darkness.

“Meow.”

They followed the sound. All the way through the winding hallway. Down, down, down.

Around one corner, then another. And another.

Finally they saw a light at the end if the tunnel. They rushed forward——out into the bright sunlight.

“Yay!” Annie shouted.

But Jack was thinking.

“Annie,” he said. “How did we get out of the false passage?”

“The cat,” said Annie.

“But how could the cat do it?” asked Jack.

“Magic,” said Annie.

Jack frowned. “But——“

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed.

The cat was bounding away. Over the sand.

“Thank you!” called Annie.

“Thanks!” Jack shouted at the cat.

His black tail waved.

Then he disappeared in the shimmering waves of heat.

Jack looked toward the palm trees. At the top of one sat the tree house. Like a bird’s nest.

“Time to go home,” Jack said.

He and Annie set off for the palm trees. It was a long hot walk back.

At last Annie grabbed onto the rope ladder. Then Jack.

Once they were inside the tree house, Jack reached for the book about Pennsyvania.

Just then he heard a rumbling sound. The same sound they had heard in the pyramid.

“Look!” Annie said, pointing out the window.

Jack looked.

A boat was beside the pyramid. It was gliding over the sand. Like a boat sailing over the sea.

Then it faded away. Into the distance.

Was it just a mirage?

Or was the ghost-queen finally on her way to the Next Life?

“Home, Jack,” whispered Annie.

Jack opened the Pennsylvania book.

He pointed to the picture of Frog Creek..

“I wish we could go home,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

The leaves began to shake.

The wind blew harder. It whistled louder.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely silent.



## 10：Another Clue

Late-morning sunlight shone through the tree house window. Shadows danced on the walls and ceiling.

Jack took a deep breath. He was lying on the floor of the tree house.

“I wonder what Mom’s making for lunch,” said Annie. She was looking out the window.

Jack smiled. Lunch. Mom, Home. It all sounded so real. So calm and safe.

“I hope it’s peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,” he said.

He closed his eyes. The wood floor felt cool. “Boy, this place is a mess,” said Annie. “We’d better make it neater. In case M comes back.”==in case:以防万一==

Jack had almost forgotten about M.

Would they ever meet the mysterious M? The person who meeted to own all the books in the tree house?

“Let’s put the Egypt book on the bottom of the pile,” said Annie.

“Good idea,” said Jack. He needed a rest before he vidited any more ancient tombs.

“Let’s put the dinosaur book on the top of the Egyph book,” siad Annie.

“Yeah, good,” said Jack. And a long rest before he visited another Tyrannosaurus rex.

“The castle book can go on the very top of the pile,” said Annie.

Jack nodded and smiled. He liked thinking about the knight on the cover of the castle book. He felt as if the knight were his friend.

“Jack,” said Annie. “Look!”

Jack opened his eyes. She was pointing at the wooden floor.

“What is it?” he asked.

“You have to see for youself.”

Jack groaned as he got up. He stood next to Annie and looked at the floor. He didn’t see anything.

“Turn your head a little,” said Annie. “You have to catch the light just right.”

Jack tipped his head to one side. Something was shining on the floor.

He tipped his head a bit more. A letter came into focus.

The letter M! It shimmered  in the sunlight.

This proved the tree house belonged to M. Absolutely for sure. No question. No doubt about it.

Jack touched the M with his finger. His skin tingled.

Just then the leaves trembled. The wind picked up.

“Let’s go down now.” he said.

Jack grabbed his backpack. Then he and Annie climbed down the ladder.

As they stood on the ground below the tree house, Jack heard a sound in the bushes.

“Who’s there?” he called.

The wood grew still.

“I’m going to bring the medallion back soon,” Jack said loudly. “And the bookmark, too. Bith of them. Tomorrow!”

“Who are you talking to?” asked Annie.

“I feel like M is nearby,” Jack whispered.

Annie’s eyes grew  wide. “Should we look for him?”

But just then their mother’s voice came from the distance. “Ja-ack! An-nie!”

Jack and Annie looked around at the trees. Then they looked at each other.

“Tomorrow,” they said together.

And they took off, running out of the wood.

They ran down their street.

They ran across their yard.

They ran into their house.

They ran into their kitchen.

They ran right into their mom.

She was making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

 

# Pirates Past Noon

## 1：Too Late!

Jack stared out his bedroom window. The rain kept falling. And falling.

“The TV said it would stop by noon,” said Annie, his seven-year-old sister.

“It’s already past noon,” said Jack.

“But we have to go to the tree house,” said Annie. “I have a feeling the M person will be there today.”

Jack pushed his galsses into place and took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure he was ready to meet the M person yet. The mysterious person who had put all the books in the magic tree house.

“Come on,” said Annie.

Jack sighed. “Okay,” he said. “You get our raincoats and boots. I’ll get the medallion and bookmark.”

Annie ran to get their rain gear.

Jack reached into his drawer. He took out the medallion.

It was gold. The letter M was engraved on it.

Then he took out the bookmark. It was made of blue leather. It had the same M on it.

Both M’s matched the M that was on the floor of the tree house.

Jack put the medallion and bookmark into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and pencil. Jack liked to take notes about inportant things.

“I got our rain stuff!” called Annie.

Jack picked up his pack and went downstairs. Annie was waiting by the back door. She was putting on her boots. “Meet you outside,” she said.

Jack pulled on his raincoat and boots. Then he put on his backpack and joined her.

The wind was blowing hard.

“Ready! Set! Go!” shouted Annie.

They kept their heads down and charged into the rainy wind.

Soon they were in the Frog Creek woods.

Tree branches swayed, flinging rainwater every everywhere.

“Yuck!” said Annie.

They splashed through puddles. Until they came to the tallest oak tree in the woods.

They looked up.

Tucked betewwn two branches was the tree house. It looked dark and lonely against the stormy sky.

Hanging from the tree house was a rope ladder. It was blowing in the wind.

Jack thought of all the books up there. He hoped they weren’t getting wet.

“The M person’s been there,” said Annie.

Jack caught  his breath. “How can you tell?” he said.

“I can feel it,” she whispered.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Inside the tree house it was chilly and damp.

But the books were dry. They were all neatly stacked along the wall. Just the way they had been the day before.

Annie picked up a castle book on top of one stack. It had taken them to the time of castles.

“Remember the knight?” she said.

Jack nodded. He would never forget the knight who had helped them.

Annie put down the castle book. She picked up the next book on the stack.

It was the dinosaur book that had taken them to the time of dinosaurs.

“Remeember?” she said.

Jack nodded.

He’d never forget the pteranodon who had saved him from the Tyrannosaurus rex.

Then Annie held up a book about ancient Egyph.

“Meow,” she said.

Jack smiled. The Egypt book had taken them to the time of pyramids. A black cat had come to the rescue there.

“And here’s the book about home,” Annie said.

She held up the book with the picture of their hometown in it.

Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.

Jack smiled again. The Pennsylvania book had brought them back home at the end of each of their adventures.

Jack sighed. Okay. He still had two main questions.

Who was the M person who had put all the books here?

And did the knight, the pteranodon, and the cat all know the M person?

Finally Jack reached into his backpack. He took out the glod medallion and the leather bookmark. He placed them on the floor. Right over the spot where the M glowed faintly in the wood.

Rain blew into the tree house.

“Brr!” said Annie. “It’s not very cozy today.”

Jack agreed with her. It was too wet and cold.

“Look.” Annie pointed to an open book lying in the corner. “I don’t remember a book being open.”

“Me neither,” said Jack.

Annie picked up the book. She stared at the picture on the page.

“Wow, this place looks great.” She showed the picture to Jack.

He saw a sunny beach. A big green parrot sitting in a palm tree. And a ship  sailing on a blue sea.

Another gust  of rainy wind blew into the tree house.

Annie point to the picture. “I wish we were there instead of here,” she said.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But where is there?”

“Too late!” came a squawk.

Jack and Annie turned quickly.

Sitting on a branch outside the window ledge of the tree house was a green parrot. Exactly like the parrot in the picture.

“Too late!” the parrot squawked again.

“A talking parrot!” said Annie. “Is your name Polly? Can I call you Polly?”

Suddenly the wind started to whistle.

“Oh no! Now we’re in big trouble!” said Jack.

The wind blew harder.

The leaves shook.

The tree house started to spin. Faster and faster!

Jack squeezed his eyes shut. Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

“Too late!” squawked Polly.



## 2：The Bright Blue Sea

Jack felt hot sunlight streaming into the tree house.

He smelled saltwater.

He heard the sound of waves.

He and Annie looked out the window.

The tree house was in a palm tree. Beyond was a bright blue sea. A tall sailing ship was on the horizon. It was just like the picture in the book.

“Too late!” squawked Polly.

“Look!” said Annie.

Polly was flying in circles above the tree house. Then she swooped down to the ocean.

“Come on, let’s follow fer! Let’s go in the water!” said Annie. She took off her raincoat and dropped it on the floor.

“Wait, we have to study the book first,” said Jack. He started to reach for the book. But Annie grabbed it.

“You can read it on the beach,” she said. Without even looking at the cover, she shoved the book into Jack’s backpack.

He sighed. Actually, the water did look wonderful.

“Okay,” Jack said. He took off his raincoat too.

“Come on!” Annie handed Jack his backpack, then started down the ladder.

Jack folded the raincoat and put it next to the stack of books. He put on his backpack. Then he went down the ladder.

As soon as Annie hit the sand, she ran toward the ocean. Jack watched her wade into the water. She was still wearing her rain boots.

“You boots, Annie,” called Jack.

She shrugged. “They’ll dry out,” she said.

Jack took off his boots and socks. He put them beside his pack. Then he rolled up his jeans. And ran across the hot sand into the waves.

The water was warn and clear. Jack could see shells and tiny fishes.

He shielded his eyes against the sun. And peered out at the sea.

The tall sailing ship seemed a bit closer.

“Where’s Polly?” said Annie.

Jack glanced around. No sign of Polly. Not in the palm trees. Not on the sunlit sand. Not over the bright blue sea.

 When Jack looked out at the sea again, the ship seem even closer. Now Jack could see its flag.

As he stared at the ship’s flag, a chill went through him.

The flag was black. With a skull and crossbones.

“Oh man,” he breathed. He started out of the water.

“What’s wrong?” said Annie. She splashed after him.

Jack ran to his backpack. Annie followed.

He grabbed the book from his backpack. He looked at the cover. For the first time, he and Annie read the title of the book.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Pirates of the Caribbean,” Jack read aloud.



## 3：Three Men in a Boat.

“We’ve come to the time of pirates!” Jack said.

“Pirates?” squeaked Annie. “Like in Peter Pan?”

Jack flipped to the picture that showed the parrot, the sea and the ship.

He read the caption under the picture:

​		Three hundred years ago, pirates raided Spanish treasure ships in the Carbbean Sea.

He grabbed his notebook and pencil from his pack. He wrote:

​		pirates in the Caribbean

He turned to the next page. There was a picture of  a pirate flag. He read:

​		The skull-and-crossbones flag was called the Jolly Roger.

“Let’s go!” said Annie.

“Wait!” said Jack. “I want to make a drawing of the flag.”

He propped the pirate book in the sand.

He started drawing the Jolly Roger.

“Don’t copy the picture in the book,” said Annie. “Look at the real thing.”

But Jack pushed his glasses into place and kept drawing.”

“Jack, some pirates are getting into a rowboat,” said Annie.

Jack kept drawing.

“Jack, the boat’s leaving the big ship,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked up.

“Look.” Annie pointed.

Jack looked. He saw the rowboat coming toward the tree house.

Jack jumped up. His glasses fell off.

“Hurry!” Annie called back to him.

Jack went down on his knees. He felt for his glasses. Where were they?

Jack saw something glinting in the sand. he reached for it. It was his glasses. He snatched them up.

Then he threw his notebook and pencil into his pack. He put the pack on his back.

He grabbed his boots and his socks. And he took off running.

“Hurry!  They’re coming!” Annie was at the top of the rope ladder.

Jack looked back at the sea. The pirates were closer to the shore.

Suddenly Jack saw the pirate book. In all the confusion he forgotten it. It was still propped in the sand.

“Oh man, I forget the book!” he said. He dropped his socks and boots below the tree house.

“Come on, Jack!” Annie shouted.

“I’ll be right back!” Jack called. “I’ve got to get the book!”

“Jack, forget it!”

But Jack was already running toward the water.

Jack grabbed the book.

“Come back!” Annie shouted.
Jack shoved the book into his backpack.

Suddenly a giant wave carried the rowboat right onto the beach.

“Run, Jack!” shouted Annie.

Three big pirates splashed onto the sand.

They had knives in their teeth.

They had pistols in their belts.

They charged toward Jack.

“Run, Jack, run!” cried Annie.



## 4：Vile Booty

Jack started to run across the hot sand. He ran as fast as he could.

But the pirates ran faster.

Before Jack knew it, the biggest pirate had grabbed him.

Jack struggled. But the pirate had huge, strong arms. He held on to Jack and laughed a mean, ugly laugh. He had a shaggy black beard. A patch covered one eye.

Jack heard Annie yelling. He saw her coming down the rope ladder.

“Stay where you are!” Jack shouted.

But Annie kept coming. “Leave him alone, you bully!” she cried.

The other two pirates laughed meanly. They were dirty and ragged.

Annie charged up to the biggest pirate. “Let him go!” she said. She hit the pirate with her fist and kicked him.

But the pirate just growled. Then he grabbed her, too. And with his giant hands, he held Jack and Annie as if they were two kittens.

“No one escapes Cap’s Bones!” he roared, His breath was terrible.

“Let go!” Annie shouted into his face.

But Cap’s Bones just smiled. All his teeth were black.

Annie fell silent.

Cap’n Bones latghed loudly. Then he turned to the other two.

“Find out what’s in their house, you dogs,” he said.

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!” they answered. And they started up the ladder to the tree house.

“What do you spy, Pinky?” shouted Cap’n Bones.

“Books, Cap’n!” Pinky shouted down.

“Aghh, books,” growled Cap’n Bones. He spit on the sand. “I want gold, you dogs!”

“Dogs are nicer than you,” said Annie.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

“What about you. Stinky?” Cap’n Bones roared.

“Just books, Cap’n!” shouted Stinky.

“Aghh, books,” said Cap’n Bones. He spit on the sand again. “I hate books! Keep looking, dogs! Find me something good!”

Cap’n Bones grabbed Jack’s backpack. “What’s in here?” he said.

“Nothing-” Jack quickly opened the pack. “Just paper, a pencil, a book.”

“Another book!” roared Cap’n Bones. “That’s vile booty!”

A gleeful shriek pierced the air.

Cap’n Bones froze. “What’s that?” he shouted.

“Look, Cap’n! Look!”

Pinky leaned out the tree house window.

He held the medallion. It glimmered in the sunlight.

Oh brother, thought Jack.

“Throw it down!” cried Cap’n Bones.

“It’s not yours!” shouted Annie.

Cap’n Bones dropped Jack and Annie. He caugh the medallion as it fell.

“Gold! Gold! Gold!” he cried. Cap’n Bones Threw back his head and laughed horribly.

He grabbed two of his pistols. He shot them onto the air. Pinky and Stinky howled like wolves.



## 5：The Kid’s Treasure.

Jack And Annie watched in horror.

The gold-greedy pirates seemed to have lost their minds.

Jack nudged Annie. Together they started to back slowly away from the pirates. Toward the tree house.

“Halt!” Cap’n Bones shouted. He aimed his pistols at them. “Not another step, lubbers!”

Jack and Annie froze.

Cap’n Bones grinned his black-toothed grin. “Tell old Bones where the rest is,” he growled. “Or prepare to meet thy doom.”

“What——what rest?” said Annie.

“The rest of the treasure!” roared Cap’n Bones. “I know it’s on this island. I have a map!”

He reached into a belt pouch and pulled out a torn piece of paper. He waved it at Jack and Annie.

“Is that a treasure map?” asked Jack.

“Aye, it’s the map telling about Kidd’s treasure.”

“Which kid’s treasure? Not us kids,” said Annie. “We don’t know anything about a kid’s treasure.”

“Why don’t you read the map?” said Jack.

“You read it!” Cap’n Bones shoved the map in Jack’s face.

Jack stared at the strange marks on the paper.

“What does that mean?” asked jack.

“What does waht mean?” asked Cap’n Bones.

“Those words.” Jack pointed at the words at the bottom of the map.

“Well, it means....” Cap’n Bones’ good eye squinted at the writing. He frowned. He coughed. He rubbed his nose.

“Aw, leave him alone,” Pinky growled at Jack.

“You know he can’t read,” said Stinky.

“Shut up!” Cap’n Bones roared at his men.

“Jack and I can read,” Annie piped up.

“Shhh,” said Jack.

“Cap’n, make  ’em read the map!” said Stinky.

Cap’n Bone gave Jack and Annie a dark look. “Read it,” he growled.

“Then will you let us go?” said Jack.

The pirate squinted his good eye. “Aye lubber. When the treasure’s in me hands, I’ll let you go.”

“Okay,” said Jack. “I’ll read it to you.” He looked at the map. “It says, The gold doth lie beneath the whale’s eye.”

“Heh?” Cap’n Bones scowled. “What’s that supposed to mean, lubber?”

Jack shrugged.

“Hang it! Take ‘em back to the ship!” Shouted Cap’n Bones. “They can rot there till they’re ready to tell us how to find Kidd’s treasure.”

Jack and Annie were tossed into the rowboat.

Waves splashed the sides. The sky ahead was drak with thunderclouds. A strong wind had started to blow.

“Row, dogs, row!” said Cap’n Bones.

Pinky and Stinky began rowing toward the big ship.

“Look!” Annie said to Jack. She pointed to the shore.

Pollly the parrot was flying over the sand.

“She wants to help us,” whispered Annie.

Polly started to fly out over the waves.

But the winds were too strong. She turned around and flew back to the island.



## 6：The Whale’s Eye.

The rowboat tossed from side to side. The waves were huge. Salty spray stung Jack’s eyes. He felt seasick.

“Hold’er steady!” shouted Cap’n Bones.

He pointed at the sea. “Or we’ll be meat for those evil brutes!”

Dark fins cut through the water. Sharks. One zoomed right by the boat. Jack could have reached out and touched it.

He shuddered.

Soon the rowboat pulled alongside the ship.

The air was filled with wild fiddle music and bagpipes playing. And Jack heard jeers, shouts, and ugly laugher.

“Hoist’em aboard!” Cap’n Bones shouted to his men.

Annie and Jack were hauled onto the deck.

The ship creaked and moaned. It rolled from side to side. Ropes flapped and snapped in the wild wind.

Everywhere they looked, Jack and Annie saw pirates.

Some were dancing. Some were drinking. Many were fighting. WIth swords. Or with their fists.

“Lock ’em in my cabin!” Cap’n Bones ordered.

A couple of pirates grabbed Jack and Annie. And threw them in the ship’s cabin. Then locked the door.

The air inside the cabin was damp and sour-smelling. A shaft of gray light came through a small round window. 

“Oh man,” said Jack. “We’ve got to figure out how to get back to the island.”

“So we can get into the tree house and go home,” said Annie.

“Right,” Jack suddenly felt tired. How would they ever get out of ths mess?

“We better examine the book,” he said.

He reached into his pack and pulled out the pirate book.

He flipped through the pages.

He looked for information to help them.

“Look,” he said.

He found a picture of pirates burying a treasure chest. “This might help.”

Together they read the words under the picture.

​		Captain Kidd was a famous pirate. It is said that he buried a treasure chest on a deserted island. The 		

​		chest was filled with gold and jewels.

“Captiain Kidd!” said Jack.

“So that’s the kid that Bones keeps talking about,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack.

Annie looked out the round window.

“And Captain Kidd’s treasure is buried somewhere on the island,” she said.

Jack took out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:

​		Captain Kidd’s treasure on island.

“Ja-ack,” Annie said.

“Shhh, wait a minute,” he said. “I’m thinking.”

“Guess what I see?” said Annie.

“What?” Jack asked. He looked back at the book.

“A whale.”

“Neat,” he said. Then he looked up. “A whale? Did you say ... a whale?”

“A whale. A huge whale. As big as a football field.”

Jack jumped up and looked put the window with her.

“Where?” Jack asked. All he could see was he island. And stormy waves. And shark fins.

“There!” said Annie.

“Where? Where?”

“There! The island is shaped like a giant whale!”

“Oh man,” whispered Jack. Now he could see it.

“See the whale’s back?” said Annie.

“Yep.” Ths slope of the island looked like the back if a whale.

“See his spout” said Annie.

“Yep.” The palm tree that held the tree house looked like the spout of the whale.

“See his eye?” said Annie.

“Yep.” A big black rock looked like the eye of the whale.

“The gold doth lie beneath the whale’s eye,” whispered Jack. “Wow.”



## 7：Gale’s a-Blowin

“So the treasure must be under that rock,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “Now we just have to get back to the island. We’ll show Cap’n Bones where the treasure is. Then while all the pirates are digging, we’ll sneak up to the tree house.”

“And make a wish to go home,” said Annie.

“Right.” Jack poke his head out of the round window of the cabin. “Cap’n Bones, sir!” he shouted.

The pirates took up the cry. “Cap’n Bones! Cap’n Bones!”

“Hey?” came a horrible voice.

Cap’n Bones stuck his ugly face through the window. His good eye glared at Jack. “What do you want, lubbers?”

“We’re ready to tell the truth, sir,” said Jack.

“Go ahead,” growled Cap’n Bones.

“We know where Captain Kidd’s treasure is.”

“Where?”

“We can’t just tell you. We have to show you,” said Annie.

Cap’n Bones gave Annie And Jack a long hard look.

“You’ll need a rope,” said Jack.

“And shovels,” said Annie.

Cap’n Bones growled. Then he roared at his men, “Get some rope and shovels!”

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!”

“Then throw these lubbers in the boat! We’re going back to the island!”

“Aye, aye, Cap’n!”

Back in the rowboat, Jack saw the sky had grown even darker with clouds. The waves were bigger. The wind was howling.

“Gale’s a-blowin!” said Pinky.

“You’ll see a gale if I don’t get me gold today, by thunder!” Cap’n Bones shouted. “Row, dogs, row!”

The three pirates battled the waves, until the rowboat reached the island. They all piled onto the shore.

Cap’n Bones grabbed Jack and Annie.

“Okay, lubbers,” he said. “Now show us where the treasure is.”

There,” said Annie. She pointed at the black rock near the tip of the island.

“Under that rock,” siad Jack.

Cap’n Bones dragged Jack and Annie down the beach to the black rock.

“Get to work!” Cap’n Bones said to Pinky and Stinky.

“What about you?” said Annie.

“Me? Work?” Cap’n Bones chuckled.

Jack gulped. How could they get away from him?

“Don’t you think you should help your friends?” he said.

Cap’n Bones gave Jack a horrible grin. “Nay. I’m going to hold you two——till there’s treasure in me hands!”



## 8：Dig，Dogs，Dig

Pinky and Stinky tied their rope around the big rock.

The wind howled. The two pirates pulled and pulled. And pulled.

“They need help!” said Jack.

“Aghh, let the dogs do the work!” growled Cap’n Bones.

“You’re not very nice to them,” said Annie.

“Who cares?” roared Cap’n Bones.

“Cap’n! We got it!” shoted Pinky.

They started pulling the rock across the sand.

“Now let’s dig where the rock was,” said Jack. “All of us.”

But Cap’n Bones ignored his suggestion.

“Dig, you dogs!” he shouted.

Pinky and Stinky started to dig. The wind blew even harder. There was going to be a thunderstorm.

“Oww! I got sand in me eyes!” Pinky whined.

“Oww! Me back hurts!” Stinky cried.

“Dig!” shouted Cap’n Bones. He held Jack and Annie with one hand. WIth the other he pulled out the gold medallion.

He tossed it at the two pirates. It fell into the hole.

“Dig for more of these, you swine!” he said.

Squawk!

“Look!” Annie said.

Polly was back! She was circling above tuem!

“Go back!” she queawked.

Stinky and Pinky looked up at the parrot. They scowled.

“Dig!” shouted Cap’n Bones.

“A big storm is comin’, Cap’n!” said Pinky.

“Go back!” said Polly.

“The bird an omen, Cap’n!” shouted Stinky.

“Dig, you dogs!” cried Cap’n Bones.

“Go back!” squawked Polly.

“The bird’s warning us!” shouted Pinky. “We’ve got to get to the ship before it’s too late!”

The two pirates threw down their shovels. They started running toward the rowboat.

“Mutineers! Come back!” shouted Cap’n Bones. He dragged Jack and Annie down the beach as he ran after his men. “Stop!”

But the pirates kept running. They got to the rowboat and pushed it into the sea.

“Wait!” cried Cap’n Bones.

Pinky and Stinky jumped into the boat. They started rowing.

“Wait!” Cap’n Bones let go of Jack and Annie. He ran into the water. “Wait, you dogs!”

He hauled himself into the rowboat.

Then the three pirates disappeared into the spray of the waves.

“Go back!” squawked Polly.

“She means us!” said Annie.

Just then the storm broke over the island. The wind howled. Rain fell in buckets.

“Let’s go!” cried Annie.

“Wait! I have to get the medallion!” shouted Jack. He ran to the hole dug by the pirates. He looked down in it.

Even in the dreary light, the medallion was shining.

Big, fat raindrops were falling into the hole, wshing away the sand.

Jack saw a patch of wood.

Then the rain cleared away more sand. And Jack saw the top of an old trunk.

He stared. Was it Captain Kidd’d treasure chest?

“Hurry, Jack!” cried ANnie. She was halfway up the tree house ladder.

“I found it! I found it!” cried Jack. “I found the treasure chest!”

“Forget the treasure chest!” said Annie. “We have to go now! The storm’s getting worse!”

Jack kept staring at the chest. Was there gold insede? Silver? Precious gems?

“Come on!” Now Annie was shouted from the tree house window.

But Jack couldn’t tear himself away. He brushed the rest of the muddy sand off the chest.

“Jack, forget the treasure chest!” cried Annie. “Let’s go!”

“Go back!” squawled Polly.

Jack looked at the parrot. She was perched on the black rock.

He stared into her wise eyes. He thought he knew her-knew her from somewhere else.

“Go back, Jack,” she said. She sounded like a person.

Okay. It was definitely time to go.

Jack took one last look at the treasure chest. He clutched the gold medallion. Then he took off, running toward the tree house.

His socks and rain boots were still there. He quickly pulled the boots on. He shoved the socks into his backpack.

The rope ladder was dancing wildly in the wind. Jack grabbed it.

The ladder swayed as Jack climbed. He was tossed this way and that. But he held on tight.

At last he pulled himself into the tree house.

“Let’s go!” he cried.

Annie was already holding the Pennsylvania book. She pointed to the picture of Frog-Creek.

“I wish we could go there!” she shouted.

The wind was already blowing hard. But now it blew even harder.

The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 9：The Mysterious M

Drip, drip.

Jack opened his eyes.

Rain was dripping from the leaves of the tree.

They were back in Frog Creek. The rain was softer. The wind was gentler. The air was sweeter.

“Oh man.” Jack sighed. “That was close.” He was still holding the gold medallion.

“Polly’s gone,” said Annie sadly. “I was hoping she might come back with us.”

“No magic creature has ever come back with us,” said Jack.

He pulled off his backpack. it was damp with rain and saltwater.

Jack took out the pirate book. He put it on the stack of books. On top of the dinosaur book. And the knight book. And the mummy book.

Then Jack put the gold medallion beside the bookmark with the letter M.

Next he went down onto his knees. And ran his finger over the shimmering M on the floor. “We didn’t find any M’s on this trip,” he said.

“Or the M person,” said Annie.

Squawk!

“Polly!” Annie cried.

The parrot swooshed into tree house. She perched on the stack of books.

Polly looked straight at Jack.

“What-what are you doing here?” he asked her.

Slowly Polly raised her bright green wings. They grew bigger and bigger until they spread out like a huge green cape.

Then, in a great swirl of colors——in a blur of feathers and light——in a flapping and stretching and screeching——a new being took shape. 

Polly was not a parrot any longer. In her place was an old women. A beautiful old woman with long white hair and piercing eyes.

She wore a green feathered cape. She perched on the stack of books. And she was very calm and very still

Neither Jack and Annie could speak. They were too amazed.

“Hello, Jack. Hello, Annie,” too old woman said. “My name is Morgan le Fay.”



## 10：Treasure Again

Annie found her voice first. “The M person she whispered.”

“Yes. I’m the M person,” said Mrogan.

“Wh-where are you from?” asked Jack.

“Have you ever heard of King Arthur?” said Morgan.

Jack nodded.

“Well, I am King Arthur’s sister,” said Mogan.

“You’re from Camelot,” said Jack. “I’ve read about Camelot.”

“What did you read about me, Jack?” said Morgan.

“You—— you’re a witch.”

Morgan smiled. “You can’t believe everything you read, Jack.”

“But are you a magician?” said Annie.

“Most call me an enchantress. But I’m also a librarian,” said Morgan.

“A librarian?” said Annie.

“Yes. And I’ve come to the 20th century, your time, to collect books. You are lucky to be born in a time with so many books.”

“For the Camelot library?” asked Jack.

“Precisely,” said Morgan. “I travel in this tree house to collext words from many defferent places around the world. And from many different time periods.”

“Did you find books here?” said Jack.”

“Oh yes. Many wonderful books. I want to borrow them for our scribes to copy.”

“Did you put all the bookmarks in them?” said Jack.

“Yes. You see, I like the pictures in the books. Sometime I want to visit the scenes in the pictures. So all the bookmark mark places I wish to go.”

“How do you get there?” asked Annie.

“I placed a spell on the tree house,” said Morgan. “So when I point to a picture and make the wish, the tree house takes me there.”

“I think you dropped this in dinosaur times,” said Jack.

He handed the gold medallion to Morgan.

“Oh, thank you! I wondered where I’d lost it,” she said. She put the medallion into a hidden pocket in her cape.

“So can anybody work the spell?” asked Annie. “Anybody who tries it?”

“Oh dear, no!” Not just anybody,” Morgan said. “You two are the only ones besides me to do it. No one else has ever even seem my tree house before.”

“Is it invisible?” asked Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “I had no idea it would ever be discovered. But then you two came along. Somehow you hooked right into my magic.”

“H-how?” asked Jack.

“Well, for two reasons, I think,” explained Morgan. “First, Annie believes in magic. So she actually saw the tree house. And her belief helped you to see it, Jack.”

“Oh man,” said Jack.

“Then you picked up a book, Jack. And because you love books so much, you caused my magic spell to work.”

“Wow,” said Annie.

“You can’t imagine my dismay when you started to take off for dinosaur times. I had to make a very quick decision. And I decided to come along.”

“Oh, so you were the pteranodon!” said Annie.

Morgan smiled.

“And the cat and the knight and Polly!” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan softly.

“You were all these things to help us?” asked Jack.

“Yes, but I must go home now. The people in Camelot need my help.”

“You’re leaving?” whispered Jack.

“I’m afraid I must,” said Morgan.

She picked up Jack’s backpack and handed it to him, Jack and Annie picked up their rain-coats. It had stopped raining.

“You won’t forget us, will you?” asked Annie, as they put their raincoats on.

“Never,” said Morgan. She smiled at both of them. “You remind me to much of myself. You love the impossible, Annie. And you love knowledge, Jack. What better combination is there?”

Morgan le Fay touched Annie’s forehead  . And then Jack . She smiled.

“Good-bye,” she said

“Good-bye,” said Annie and Jack.

Annie left the tree house first. Jack followed. THye climbed down the rope ladder for the last time.

They stood below the oak tree and looked up.

Morgan was looking out the window. Her long white hair blew in the breeze.

Suddenly the wind began to blow.

The leaves began to shake.

A loud whistling sound filled the air.

Jack covered his ears and squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.

Jack opened his eyes.

The tree house was gone.

All gone. Absolutely gone.

Annie and Jack stood a moment, staring up at the empty oak tree. Listen to the silence.

Annie sighed. “Let’s go,” she said softly.

Jack just nodded. He felt too sad to speak. As they started walking, he put his hand into his pockets.

He felt something.

Jack pulled out the gold medallion. “Look!” he said. “How did——”

Annie smiled. “Morgan must have put it there,” she said.

“But how?”

“Magic,” said Annie. “I think it means she’ll be coming back.”

Jack smiled. He clutched the medallion as he and Annie took off through the wet, sunny woods.

As they walked, the sun shined through the woods. And all the wet leaves sparkled.

Everything, in fact, was shining.

Leaves, branches, puddles, bushes, grass, vines, wild flowers—— all glittered like jewels.

Or gleamed like gold.

Annie had been right, thought Jack.

Forget the treasure chest.

They had treasure at home. A ton of it. Everywhere.



# Night of the Ninjas

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvanis, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to be there.

Jack and Annie visited the time of dinosaurs, old Englist, ancient Egypy, and a pirate ship.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She traveled through time and space, gathering books.

Jack and Annie are about to start a whole new adventure... in Night of the Ninjas



## 1：Back into the woods

“Let’s look again, Jack,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie were walking home from the library. The path went right by the Frog Creek woods.

Jack sighed. “We looked this morning,” he said. “We looked the day before. And the day before that.”

“Then you don’t have to come,” said Annie. “I’ll go look by myself.”

She took off into the woods.

“Annie, wait!” Jack called. “It’s almost dark! We have to get home!”

But Annie had disappeared among the trees.

Jack stared at the woods. He ws starting to lose hope. Maybe he would never see Morgan again. 

Weeks had passed. And there had not been one sign of Morgan le Fay. Nor had there been one sign of her magic tree house. 

“Jack!” Annie called from the woods. “It’s back!”

Oh, she’s just pretending as usual, Jack thought. But his heart started to race.

“Hurry!” called Annie.

“She better not be kidding,” said Jack.

He took off into the woods to find Annie.

Night was falling fast. Crickets chirped loudly. It was hard to see through the shadows.

“Annie!” Jack shoted.

“Here!” she called.

Jack kept walking. “Here where?” he called back.

“Here here!”

Annie’s voice came from above.

Jack looked up.

“Oh man,” he breathed.

Annie waves from the window of a tree house. It was in the tallest oak in the woods. A long rope ladder hung down from it.

The magic tree house was back.

“Come on up!” Annie shouted.

Jack ran to the rope ladder. He started climbing

He climbed and climbed and climbed.

As he climbed, he looked out over the woods. High above the treetops it was still light. 

At last, Jack pulled himself into the tree house.

Annie sat in the shadows. Books were scattered everywhere.

On the floor the letter M glowed in the dim light. The M stood for Morgan le Fay.

But there was no sign of Morgan herself.

“I wonder where Morgan is,” said Jack.

“Maybe she went to the library to get some more books,” said Annie.

“We were just at the library. We would have seen her,” said Jack. “Besides, the library’s closed now.”

Squeak!

A little mouse ran out from behind a stack of books. It ran to the M shining in the floor.

“Yikes,” said Annie.

The mouse sat on the middle of the M. It looked up at Jack and Annie.

“Oh, it’s so cute,” Annie said.

Jack had to admit the mouse was cute. It had brown-and-white fur and big dark eyes.

Annie slowly reached out her hand. The mouse didn’t move. Annie patted its tiny head.

“Hi, Peanut,” she said. “Can I call you Peantu?”

“Oh brother,” said Jack.

“Do you know where Morgan is?” Annie asked the mouse.

Squeak.

“You’re nuts, Annie,” said Jack. “Just because the moues is in the tree house doesn’t mean it’s magic. It’s a plain old mouse that crawled in. that’s all.”

Jack looked around again. He saw a piece of paper on the floor.

“What’s that?” he said.

“What’s what?” asked Annie.

Jack went over and picked up the paper. There was writing on it.

“Oh man,” whispered Jack, after he read the words.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“A note,” said Jack. “It must ne from Morgan. I think she’s in big trouble!”



## 2：The Open Book

Jack showed Annie the piece of paper. It said:

​		help me, under a s....  Find 4 thin

“Oh no,” said Annie. “We have to help her. But what’s a thin?”

“Maybe she was trying to write things,” said Jack. “See how the n sort of runs off the page?”

“Maybe the spell was starting to make her disappear of something,” said Annie.

“Right,” said Jack. “I wonder if she left any other clues.” He glanced around the tree house.

“Look!” Annie pointed at a book in hte corner. “That’s the only open book,” she said.

Jack looked around again. Annie was right. He felt a shiver go down his spine.

Jack went over to the book and picked it up. He held it near the window. Light from the setting run was golden on the page.

Jack stared at the picture on it. In the picture were trees with white flowers. The trees were on the side of a mountain. Near a wide, rushing stream.

Two people were also in the picture. They wore dark clothes. They had black scarves over their faces. And long swords strapped to their backs.

“Oh man,” whispered Jack.

“Who are they?” Annie asked.

“Ninjas, I think,” said Jack.

“Ninjas? Really?” said Annie.

“Morgan must have left the book open to this page for a reason,” said Jack.

“Maybe that’s where she was when the spell got her,” Annie said.

“Or maybe that’s where the four things are,” said Jack.

“Let’s go!” said Annie.

“Now?” said Jack.

“Yes, Morgan’s in trouble! She needs us now!” said Annie.

“But we should read this book first,” said Jack. “So we’ll be prepared”

“Forget it!” said Annie. “Every minute counts!” She grabbed the book from Jack.

“Give it back,” he said. “We have to find out about this place.”

Annie held the book out of reach. “We don’t even know where there is!” Jack said.

But Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go here,” she said.

The leaves of the oak tree began to shake.

Squeak!

“Don’t be scared, Peanut,” said Annie. She scooped up the mouse. Then she put it in the pouch of her sweatshirt.

The wind began to blow.

The blew harder and harder.

The tree house started to spin.

Faster and faster.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still. Absolutely still.

Except for the sound of rushing water.



## 3：E-hy!

Jack opened his eye.

Annie was already looking out the window. The mouse peeked out the pouch.

Jack looked out the window, too. The air was fresh and cool.

The tree house was in a tree with white flowers. The tree was in a grove of trees on the side of a mountain. Nearby a wild stream rushed downhill.

Two ninjas were strading on rocks near the water. They were staring at the valley below.

One ninja was tall. The other was short. They wore black pants and shirts. They had black scarves around their heads. And swords strapped to their backs.

It was exactly like the picture in the book.

Jack crouched below the window.

“Be careful,” he wispered. “Don’t let them see you.”

“Why not?” Annie whispered back.

“They might think we’re some kind of enemy,” said Jack quietly.

Annie crouched beside him.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. Now he was going to look at the ninja book.

He picked up the book. He turned to the begining. He read:

​		Very little is known about the shadowy warriors called ninjas.

​		Historians believe that ninjas lived in Japan between the 14th and 17th centruies. Both men and women 		were ninjas. Sometimes they fought to protect their families. Sometimes warlords hired them to be spies.

“Wow,” whispered Jack. “We’re in Japan, hundreds of years ago.”

Jack opened his backpack. He pulled out his notebook and pencil. He liked to take notes. He wrote:

​		ninjas were warriors in old Japan

“Jack” whispered Annie. “They’re looking up. I think they know we’re here.”

Jack peeked over the windowsill. His eyes met the dark eyes of the tall ninja.

“E-hy!” the ninja cried. He dashed toward the tree. The other ninja followed.

“Oh no!” said Annie.

“We’ve got to go!” Jack said. “Where’s the Pennsylcania book?”

He and Annie looked around wildly.

But where was the book about Pennsylvania? It had the picture of the Frog Creek woods in it. Jack and Annie couldn’t get home without it.

“It’s not anywhere!” cried Annie.

“We’ve got to do something, Fast!” said Jack. “Pull up the ladder!”

He and Annie grabbed the top of the rope ladder. They pulled the ladder into the tree house.

But the tall ninja leaped at the tree trunk. Then he started climbing up the tree! the short ninja followed. They climbed just like cats. 

Jack and Annie huddled in a corner.

The ninjas climbed into the tree house. Neither one made a sound.



## 4：Gaptured

The ninjas pulled iron bands off their hands.

The bands had spikes like claws on them.

“That’s how they climbed the tree,” Annie whispered to Jack.

The ninjas stared at Jack and Annie with dark, piercing eyes. The rest of their faces were covered by their scarves.

Jack felt frozen under their stared.

Annie wasn’t frozen, though. She stepped right up to them.

“Hi,” she said.

The ninjas didn’t say “hi” back. They didn’t move at all. They were as still as Jack.

“We’re trying to help our friend, Morgan,” said Annie.

She held up Morgan’s note.

The tall ninja took the note from her. He looked at it. THen he gave it to the short ninja.

The two ninjas stared at each other. Then they looked back at Jack and Annie.

Finally the short ninja nodded noce. He put the note into the pocket of his shirt.

“You can help us?” Annie asked.

Neither ninja spoke. Jack wished he could see their faces. He couldn’t tell what they were thinking.

The short ninja tossed the rope ladder back out of the tree house. The tall one pointed down the ladder. Then he pointed at Jack and Annie.

Uh-oh, thought Jack. Were they being captured?

“Us? Go with you?” said Annie.

The ninja nodded.

“Oh boy!” said Annie.

“Oh boy? Is she nuts? wondered Jack.”

The short ninja darted down the ladder. He went hand over hand. His feet didn’t touch the rungs of the ladder.

The tall one did the same.

Jack gasped. The ninjas moved very fast. They were like spiders dropping from webs.

“Wow!” said Annie.

“Now’s our chance to leave,” said Jack. “Quick!” He looked around the tree house again. Where was that Pennsylvanis book?

“Let’s go with them, Jack,” said Annie.

“No! This isn’t a game!” Jack said.

“But I think they know something about Morgan!” said Annie.

She started down the ladder.

“Come back!” said Jack.

But it was too late.

Jack sighed. “Why does this always happen?” he asked himself.

“Come on Jack!” came Annie’s voice form below.

Jack put his notebook and the ninja book into his pack. He pushed his glasses into place. And he started down the ladder.

Jack joined Annie and the ninjas on the ground.

The sun had fallen behind the hills. The sky was streaked with red and gold.

The mouse peeked out from Annie’s sweatshirt pouch.

“Don’t be scared, Peanut,” Annie whispered. “We’ll take care of you.”

Great, thought Jack. But who is going to take care of us?

The short ninja held Jack’s arm in one hand and Annie’s arm in the other. He led them through the twilight. The tall ninja walked behind them.

“Where are we going?” Jack asked.

The ninjas stopped near the rushing water of the wide stream. The water roared as it raced downhill.

The short ninja looked at Jack and Annie. He let go of their arms. Then he pushed them toward the stream.

“You want us to cross it?” shouted Annie.

The ninja nodded. Then he and the short ninja stepped into the wild stream. They started wading across.

“Let’s run back to the tree house!” said Jack.

“No, we have to follow them!” said Annie. “For Morgan’s sake!”

Jack took a deep breath. She was right.

Annie grabbed Jack’s hand. Together they stepped into the water.

“YIKES!” They both screamed and jumped put.

It was the coldest water Jack had ever felt! It was colder than ice. It was so cold it felt like fire.

“I can’t go back in.” said Annie, shivering.

“Me neither,” said Jack. “I’ll have a heart attack.”

The ninjas looked at Jack and Annie. Then they turned around and came back.

The tall ninja grabbed Jack.

“Help!” Jack cried.

But the ninja lifted Jack high into the air. And put him on his shoulder.

The short ninja put Annie on his shoulder.

Then the two ninjas stepped into the stream again. The icy wild waters swirled around them. It went up to the short ninja’s waist.

But the ninjas moved through the stream as calmly as two sailing ships.



## 5：Flames in the Mist

The water grew shallow again. Then they were on dry land. The ninjas lowered Jack and Annie to the ground.

“Thanks,” said Annie.

“Thanks,” said Jack.

Squeak, said the mouse.

The ninjas said nothing, but they looked around.

Jack looked around, too. A full moon was rising in the sky. Dark rocks dotted the side of the mountain.

Then he ninjas started moving. They went silently up the slope, between the rocks.

Jack and Annie followed them. Jack wasn’t afraid of the ninjas now. In fact, he was starting to like them. Maybe they really could help find Morgan.

The ninjas moved silently. But Jack and Annie made plenty of noise.

They panted as they climbed the rocky hillside. Their wet sneakers made squishy sounds.

Suddenly the ninjas froze. Jack could see their eyes darting around. Voices were coming from the valley below. Jack saw torches flaming in the mist.

The ninjas started moving faster. Jack and Annie hurried after them.

“Who’s carrying the torches?” Annie asked. 

Jack was too out of breath to speak. He also didn’t have an answer.

They came to a pine forest. Night birds called out. Wind rattled the branches.

The ninjas moved like ghosts through the forest. They appeared and disappeared, through moonlight and shadowns.

Jack and Annie struggled to keep up.

Finally the ninjas came to a stop.

One ninja held out his hand, as if to say, Wait. Then both ninjas stepped away into the shadows of the trees. And were gone.

“Where did they go?” said Annie.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book can tell us.”

He pulled the ninja book out of his pack.

He turned the pages until the came to a picture of a cave.

By the light of the full moon, he read:

​		Sometimes ninjas held meetings in hidden mountain caves to plan secret missions.

“Oh man,” said Jack, “I bet they went inside a hidden cave.”

He pulled put his notebook and pencil. He wrote:

​		meetings in hidden caves

Jack turned the page, He stared at a picture of a ninja sitting on a mat. He read:

​		Ninjas took orders from a ninja master. The master was s mysterious wise  person who knew many 		

​		secrets of nature.

“Wow,” whidpered Jack.

Just then he two ninjas returned. Jack quicky put his books away.

The short ninja motioned for Jack and Annie to follow. In the shadows was the entrance of a drak cave.

“What’s in there?” Annie whispered.

“The ninja master,” Jack whispered back.



## 6：Shadow Warrior

Jack and Annie went into the cave. They followed the ninja through the darkness.

The back of the cave was lit with dozens of candles. Shadows danced on the walls.

In the flickering light, Jack saw a dark figure sitting on a woven mat.

The ninja master.

The ninja bowed to the master. Then he stepped to one side.

The master stared at Jack and Annie.

“Sit,” he said.

Jack and Annie sat on the the cold, hard floor.

Squeak.

The mouse poked its head out of Annie’s pouch.

“It’s okay, Peanut,” said Annie.

The master stared at the mouse for a moment. Then he looked at Jack. “Who are you?” he asked.

“I’m Jack and that’s my sister, Annie,” Jack answered.

“Where do you come from?” the master asked.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvanis,” Annie answered.

“Why are you here?” he asked.

“We’re trying to help our friend Morgan le Fay,” said Jack. “She left ue a message.”

Annie point to the short ninja. “We gave the message to him.”

“You mean, you gave the message to her,” said the ninja master. “And she has given it to me.”

“She?” said Jack and Annie together.

The women ninja’s eyes sparkled. Jack thought she might be smiliing.

The master held up Morgan’s note.

“Perhaps I can help you,” he said. “But first you must prove yourselves worthy of my help.”

Just then the tall ninja appeared. He made a sign to the master.

The master stood up. He handed Morgan’s note to Annie.

“We must go now,” he said. “The samurai are close.”

“Samurai?” said Jack. He knew that the samurai were fierce Japanese fighters.

“Were they the ones in the valley?” Jack asked. “The ones with the torches?”

“Yes, our family is at war with them,” said the master. “We must leave before they find ue.”

“But what about helping Morgan?” said Annie.

The master strapped in his sword.

“I have no time now,” he said. “I must go.”

“Can’t we go with?” said Annie.

“No, there is no place for you where we are going. You must find your way back to you house in the trees.”

“Alone?” said Jack.

“Yes. You must go alone. And beware of the samurai.”

“Why?” said Jack.

“They will think you are one of us,” said the master. “They will ask you no questions. They will show you no mercy.”

“Yikes,” whispered Annie.

“But you have seen the way of the ninja. You can practice it yourselves now,” said the master.

“H-how?” said Jack.

“Remember three things,” said the master.

“What?” said Jack.

“Use nature. Be nature. Follow nature.”

“I can do that!” Annie said.

Jack looked at her. “You can?” he siad.

The master turned to Jack. “Your tree house lies to the east. That is the way you must go,” he said.

How? wondered Jack. How do we find the east?

Before he could ask, the master bowed. Then he disappeared into the shadows.

The two ninjas led Jack and Annie out of the cave, into the moonlight.

The tall one pointed at the pine forest. Then they too disappeared into the darkness.

Jack and Annie were all alone.



## 7：To the East

Jack and Annie stood still for a long moment.

Annie spoke first. “Well, I guess the tall ninja was pointing to the east,” she said. “I guess that’s the way we go.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “I need to write some stuff down.”

He took out his notebook. In the moonlight, he wrote：

​		1: use nature

​		2: be nature

​		3: follow nature

“Look, Jack,” whispered Annie. “Do I look like a ninja?”

He looked at her. She had pulled her sweatshirt hood over her head and tied the srtings tightly.

She did look like a ninja——a very small one.

“Good idea,” Jack whispered. He pulled his hood up, too.

“Okay, let’s go,” said Annie.

Jack put his notebook away. Then he and Annie headed  east into the woods.

They slipped between trees. And more trees. And more trees.

All the trees looked the same. Jack got confused. Were they still going in the right direction?

“Wait,” he said.

Annie stopped. They both stared at the woods around them.

“Do you think we’re still going east?” asked Jack.

“I guess so,” said Annie.

“We can’t just guess,” said Jack. “We have to know for sure.”

“How do we do that?” said Annie. “We don’t have a compass.”

Just then the master’s words came back to Jack.

“The ninja master said to use nature,” he said.

“How do we do that?” said Annie.

“Wait, I remember something——” Jack close his eyes.

He remembered something in a camping book. Now what was it?

He opened his eyes. “I’ve got it! First we need a stick,” he said.

Annie pick up a stick. “Here——” she said.

“Great, now we just need a space with moonlight,” said Jack.

“There——” said Annie.

They moved into a moonlit space between the shadows.

“Now push the stick into the ground,” Jack said.

Annie pushed the stick into the ground.

“The stick’s shadow looks like it’s more than six inches,” said Jack. “What do you think.”

“It looks like it,” said Annie.

“Okay. Then that means the shadow’s pointing east,” said Jack.

“Neat,” said Annie.

“So that way is east!” Jack pointed to a new direction. “At least I hope it is.”

“We’re real ninjas now!” said Annie.

“Yep,” said Jack. “Maybe we are. Come on!”

They took off——heading east, they hoped.

Soon they were out of the pine woods and walking down the rocky mountainside. They moved slowly from rock of rock. Finally they rested against a giant rock.

“Let’s check our direction again,” said Jack.

Annie stuck another stick into th dirt.

“There,” he said. He pointed to the shadow on the ground. “That way——”

Annie peeked over the rock, down the mountain.

“Yikes,” she said softly.

Jack looked, too. His heart nearly stopped.

There were flames of fire coming up the mountain. The samurai!

Jack and Annie ducked behind the rock.

Squeak, said the mouse.

“Quiet, Peanut,” said Annie.

Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the ninja book.

“I hope something in here can help us,” he said.

Jack flipped through page after page until he found what he was looking for. It was a picture of warriors wearing bamboo armor. They were holding swords, He read:

​		The samurai were fierce Japanese fighters. They carried two swords to cut down their enemies.

Annie tapped Jack on the shoulder.

Jack looked at her.

She pointed up the mountain.

A figure was coming down toward them. He was very near.

In the moonlight, his bamboo armor was shining. His two swords were gleaming.

It was was a samurai warrior!

 

## 8：Dragon Water

Jack and Annie crouched together. Samurai were on both sides of them now. They were trapped!

Jack pressed against the rock.

The warrior stepped closer and closer. He looked to the right. He looked to the left.

Jack held his breath.

“Be nature,” whispered Annie.

“What?” Jack whispered back.

“Be nature. Be a rock.”

Oh brother, thought Jack. This was nuts. But he squeezed his eyes shut. Then he tried to be part of the rock.

Jack tried to be as still as to the rock. As solid as the rock. As quiet as the rock.

Soon he started feeling as strong as the rock. As safe as the rock. He wanted to be the rock forever.

Squeak.

“He’s gone,” said Annie. “They’re all gone.”

Jack opened his eyes. The samurai warrior was gone. Jack stood up and looked over the rock. The torchches were gone, too.

“Let’s go, ” Annie said.

Jack took a deep breath. He felt great——he was getting more and more like a ninja every minute. Maybe even like a ninja master.

“East!” he said.

And they went east. Down the mountain, between the rocks. Until they came to the wide, icy stream.

The water seemed even wilder than before.

“I don’t see the tree house,” said Annie.

Jack looked across the stream to the dark grove of trees. Moonlight shone on their pale flowers. But where was the tree house?

“I don’t see it either,” said Jack. “We have to cross the water frist. Then we’ll try and find it.”

The water was crashing and rushing over rocks.

Squeak. The mouse peeked out from its pouch.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Annie. She patted the mouse’s little head. “Be like us. Be like a ninja too.”

“Let’s go,” Jack said.

He took a deep breath and stepped into the stream. The icy water swirled up to his knees. The current knocked him over.

Jack grabbed some weeds. He held on tight as water swirled around him.

He was freezing to death!

“Jack!” Annie grabbed Jack’s arms. She helped him back onto the bank.

“That was close!” said Annie.

Jack wiped his glasses. Luckily, they hadn’t fallen off in the water.

“Are you okay?” said Annie.

“N-not really,” said Jack, his teeth chattering. He was chilled to the bone.

“We’ll never get across,” said Annie. 

“We’ll drown if we try.”

“Or fr-freeze to death,” said Jack.

He pulled off the hood of his sweatshirt. He didn’t feel much like a ninja anymore.

Annie pulled off her hood, too. She sighed. “What can we do?” she said.

Squeak.

Peanut climbed out of Annie’s sweatshirt pouch and leaped onto the ground.

The mouse scampered away.

“Peanut, come back!” Annie called.

“No,” said Jack. “We have to follow Peanut.”

“Why?” asked Annie.

“We have to do what the master said!” said Jack. “Follow nature!”

“Oh. Right!” said Annie. “Follow Peanut! But where is Peanut?”

In the moonlight Jack saw the little mouse. It was running through the grass along the stream.

“There!” he cried. “Come on!”

Annie hurried after Jack. Jack hurried after Peanut. They ran beside the rushing waters.

A moonlit branch had fallen across a narrow part of the stream. It touched both shores.

The mouse was running over the branch.

“Peanut’s going over a bridge!” said Annie. She started to follow.

“Wait!” cried Jack. “We can’t go on that branch. It’s too small! It’ll break!”



## 9：Mouse-walk

The mouse vanished into the tall grass on the other side of the stream.

Jack and Annie stared at the tree house.

“We have to try to cross it,” said Annie. “We’re supposed to follow nature.”

“Forget it,” said Jack. “It’s too little. It’ll crack in a second.”

“Maybe if we pretent we’re mice, we can do it,” said Annie.

“Oh brother,” said Jack. “Not again.”

“If you could be a rock, you can be a mouse,” said Annie. “Just be teeny and light and fast.”

Jack took a deep breath.

“We have to,” said Annie.

“Okay,” Jack said.

“Say ‘queak,’”said Annie.

“You’re nuts!” said Jack.

“Just do it,” said Annie. “It’ll help you feel more like a mouse.”

Jack groaned. “Okay,” he said. “Squeak.”

“Squeak,” said Annie.

“Squeak, squeak, squeak,” they said together.

“Let’s go! Hurry!” said Annie.

Jack stepped onto the branch.

I’m teeny. I’m light. I’m fast, he thought. Then he darted across the branch.

Jack moved so quickly, he didn’t think about anything——except getting to the other side.

He forgot the wild, freezing water. He forgot the smallness of the branch.

Suddenly Jack was on the other side. Suddenly Annie was right beside him.

They laughed and fell together into the grass.

“See! See! The branch didn’t break!” said Annie.

“I guess it was big enough,” said Jack. “I guess we just had to think the right way.”

“The Peanut way,” said Annie.

“Yeah,” siad Jack, smiling. He felt great.

He was still wet from his fall into the stream. But he didn’t mind anymore.

Jack pushed his glasses into place and stood up. “Okay, now we just have to find the tree house,” he said.

“No, we don’t,” said Annie. She pointed up.

The tree house was outlined against the moonlit sky. High in a tree. Surrounded by white flowers.

In the distance came the sound of voices. Then Jack saw flames.

“The samurai are coming back,” said Jack. “We have to go.”

“Where’s Peanut?” said Annie. “We can’t leave Peanut.”

“We have to,” said Jack.

The voices of the samurai were getting closer. So were their torches.

“Come on,” Jack said. He grabbed Annie’s hand. He pulled her toward the rope ladder.

“Oh Jack——” she said sadly.

“Go! Go!”

Annie started up the rope ladder.

Jack followed. He felt sad, too. He liked that little mouse now. He liked it a lot.

They climbed up and up.

Just before they got to the top, Jack heard it.

Squeak.

“Oh wow!” cried Annie. “Peanuts’s inside!”

Annie pulled herself into the tree house. Jack followed.

He gasped.

Someone else was in the tree house, too.

A dark figure was sitting in the corner.

“You have gone well,” the figure siad.

It was the ninja master.

“You  have followed the way of the ninja,” he said.

“Oh man,” breathed Jack.

Squeak.

The master was holding Peanut.

“Take good care of your little helper,” he said, handing the mouse to Annie.

Annie kissed the mouse’s tiny head.

“And take this——” said the master. He held his hand out toJack.

He gave Jack a small, round stone.

“This moonstone will help you find your missing friend,” the master said.

Jack stared at the stone. Was this one of the four thing?

“You must go home now,” said the master.” He picked up the Pennsylvania book and handed it to Annie.

“Where did you find it?” asked Jack.

“Here,” said the master. “You did not see it before. Because your heart knew you had a mission to complete first.”

“What about you?” said Annie. “Can you come with us?”

“Yes,” said Jack. “We need help finding Morgan.”

The master smiled. “No, my friends. I must stay here. There will be more help along the way. But you must find the way on your own,”

Annie opened the book. She found the picture of Frog Creek.

She pointed to it. “I wish we could go where,” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The white flowers started to shake. Coulds covered the moon.

“Remember,”  the master said, “keep a kind heart.”

Then he swung silently down the rope ladder. he disappeared into the dark night.

“Wait!” Jack called. There was so mush he wanted to ask the master. About nature. About ninjas. About their mission.

But the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Jack gripped the stone in his hand. He squeezed his eyes shut.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still. 



## 10：Night, Peanut

Jack opened his eyes.

Then he opened his fist. He stared at the moonstone in his hand. It was clear and smooth. It almost seemed to glow.

“We’re home,” said Annie.

Squeak.

Annie and the mouse were looking out the window.

Jack looked with them.

The sun was setting in ht distance.

No time at all had passed in Frog Creek. 

They heard their neighbor’s dog, Henry, bark. They heard crickets chirping.

In the distance, they could see their dad step out of their house. He stood on their porch.

“Ja-ack! An-nie!” he called.

Time for dinner.

“Com-ing!” Annie shouted.

Jack sat back on his heels. He looked at the moonstone again.

“I guess we have one of the four things,” he said.

“We’ll look for the other three tomorrow,” Annie said.

Jack nodded. They had a lot more work to do.

He put the moonstone in his pocket.

He pulled on his pack.  

“Ready?” he said.

“Wait,” said Annie. She took off one of her sneakers. She pulled off her sock. Then she put her sneaker back on.

“What are you doing?” siad Jack.

“I’m making a bed,” she said.

“A what?”

“Bed! You know, for Peanut to sleep in.” Annie picked up the mouse. She tucked it inside her sock.

“Night, Peanut,” she said softly.

Squeak.

“Oh brother,” said Jack.

Annie held the mouse close to Jack.

“Kiss it goodnight, Jack,” she said.

“Don’t be silly,” he said. “Let’s go.”

“Thanks for helping us,” Annie said to the mouse.

She put Peanut gently down on the glowing M. She pulled Morgan’s message out of her pouch. And put it next to the mouse.

“See you tomorrow,” she said. Then she started down the ladder.

Jack started at the mouse. It looked back at him.

For a moment, its dark eyes looked old and wise.

“Come on, Jack!” called Annie.

Jack kissed its tiny head.

“Night-night, Peanut,” he whispered.

Then Jack headed down the rope ladder.

It got darker and darker as he went down.

By the time he stepped onto the gorund, it was almost completely black.

“Where are you?” said Jack.

“Here,” said Annie. Her hand bumped his. He took it.

“Careful,” he said.

“Careful yourself,” she said.

Together they took off through the cool, dard woods.

They moved silently and swiftly——two shadow warriors returning home.



# Afternoon on the Amazon

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woodsl

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Jack and Annie visited the time of dinosaur, knights, pyramids, priates, and ninjas. Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belong to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through them and space, gathering book.

In their last adventure, Night of the Ninjas, Jack and Annie learned that Morgan was under a spell. To free her, Jack and Annie have to find four special things.

In old Japan, they found the first thing: a moonstone.

Now Jack and Annie are about to set out in search of the second thing.... in Afternoon on the Amazon.



## 1：Where’s Peanut?

“Hurry, Jack!” shouted Annie.

Annie ran into the Frog Creek woods.

Jack followed her.

“It’s still here!” Annie called.

Jack caught up with Annie. She stood beside a tall oak tree.

Jack looked up. The magic tree house was shining in the afternoon sunlight.

“We’re coming, Peanut!” Annie called.

She grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

Jack followed. They climbed and climbed. Finally they climbed into the tree house.

“Peanut?” said Annie.

Jack took off his backpack. He looked around.

Sunlight slanted across a stack of books——books about ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

The letter M shimmered on the wooden floor. M for Morgan le Fay.

“I don’t think Peanut’s here,” said Jack.

“I wonder where she is,” said Annie.

“How do you know Peanut’s a she?” asked Jack.

“I just know it,” said Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

Squeak!

Annie laughed. “Look, Jack!”

A samll pink sock was moving across the floor. Yesterday Annie had turned her sock into a bed for Peanut.

Annie pick up the tiny lump.

Squeak.

A brown-and-white mouse peeked out of the sock. She looked from Annie to Jack with her big eyes.

Jack laughed. “Hi, Peanut,” he said.

“WIll you help us again today?” asked Annie.

In old Japan, Peanut had helped them when they’d gotten lost.

“We have to find three more thing for Morgan,” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “First we have to find a clue that tells us where to begin.” he said.

“Guess what,” said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

“We don’t have to look very far.” She pointed at a corner of the tree house.

In the shdows was an open book.



## 2：Big Bugs

“Wow,” said Jack, picking up the book. “The ninja book was open yesterday. Now this one. Who opened them?”

Jack closed the book and looked at the cover.

It showed a pickture of a green forest. The trees were very tall and close togerther.

On the cover were the words The Rain Forest.

“Oh, wow,” said Jack

“Oh, no, said Annie.”

“What’s wrong?” said Jack.

“I learned about the rain forest in school.” said Annie. “It’s filled with big bugs and spiders.”

“I know,” said Jack. “Half of them have never even been named.”

“It’s creepy,” said Annie.

“It’s neat,” said Jack. He wanted to take losts of notes in the rain forest. Maybe he could even name some unknown bugs.

“Neat? Yuk, ” said Anie. She shivered.

“I don’t get it,” said Jack. “You weren’t afraid of dinosaurs.”

“So?”

“You weren’t afraid of the castle guards or the mummy’s ghost.”

“So?”

“You weren’t afraid of pirates or ninjas.”

“So?”

“You’re not afraid of really scary things. But you’re afraid of little bugs and spiders. That doesn’t make sense.”

“So?”

Jack sighed. “Listen,” he said. “we have to go there. To help Morgan. That’s why the book was left open.”

“I know that,” said Annie. frowning.

“Plus, the rain forest are being cut down,” said Jack. “Don’t you want to see one before it’s too late?”

Annie took a deep breath and slowly nodded.

“Okay, then, let’s go,” said Jack.

He opened the book again. He pointed to a picture that showed blue sky, green leaves. and bright flowers.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind began to blow.

Squeak.

“Stay here, Peanut,” said Annoe as he put the mouse in her pocket.

The wind picked up. The tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The wind was whistling now. The tree house was spinning faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Wild sound broke the silence.

Screeeeeeeh!

Buzzzzzzz!

Chirp! Chirp!



## 3：Yikes!

Jack opened his eyes.

The air was hot and steamy.

“It looks like we landed in some bushes,” said Annie.

She was peeking out of the tree house window. Peanut was peeking out of Annie’s pocket.

Jack peeked put of the tree hosue, too.

They had landed in a sea of shiny green leaves. Outside there were flowers, bright butterflies, and birds. Just as in the book.

“That’s strange,” said Jack. “I wonder why we didn’t land in a tree. The way we always do.”

“I don’t know,” said Annie. “But let’s hurry and find the thing for Morgan. So we can get back home before we meet any big bugs.”

“Wait. This seems weird,” said Jack. “I don’t understand why we landed in bushes. I’d better read about this.”

“Oh, come on,” said Annie. “We don’t even need the ladder. We can just climb out the window.”

Annie put Peanut in her pocket. She stuck one leg out window.

“Wait!” Jack grabbed Annie’s other leg. He read:

​		The rain forest is in three layers. Thick treetops, after over 150 feet 

​		in the air, make up the top layer.  This is call the forest canopy. 

​		Below the canopy is the understory, then the forest floor.

“Get back in here!” cried Jack. “We’re probably more than 150 feet above the ground! In the forest canopy.”

“Yikes!” said Annie. She slipped back into the tree house.

“We have to use the ladder,” said Jack. He got on his hands and knees. He moved leaves away from the hole in the floor. He looked down.

The ladder seemed to fall between the branches of a giant tree. But Jack couldn’t see beyond that.

“I can’t tell what’s down there,” he said. “Be careful.”

Jack put the rain forest book in his backpack. Then he stepped onto the rope ladder.

He started down. Annie followed with Peanut in her pocket.

Jack pushed through the leaves.

He came to the understory below the canopy.

He look down at the forest floor. It was very far away.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

This world was completely different from the one above the treetops.

Now that they were out of the sun, it was cooler. It was also damp and very quiet.

Jack shivered. It was the spookiest place he had ever seen.



## 4：Millions of Them!

Jack didn’t move. He kept staring down at the forest floor.

“What’s wrong?” Annie called from above.

Jack didn’t answer.

“You don’t see any giant spiders, do you?” Annie said.

“Well...no.” Jack took a deep breath.

We have to keep going, he thought. We have to find the special thing for Morgan.

“No spiders. Nothing scary,” Jack called. And he started down the ladder again.

Jack and Annie climbed down through the understory. Finally they stepped onto the forest floor.

Only a few rays of light slanted through the gloom.

The tree were very, very tall and very wide. Vines and moss were hanging everywhere. The ground was covered with dead leaves.

“Before we do anything, I’d better check the book,” said Jack.

He pulled out the rain forest book. He found a picture of the dark world under the treetops.

He read:

​		In the rain forest, many living creatures blend in with their surroundings. This is called camouflage.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. He closed the book and looked around. “There’re tons of creatures down here. We just can’t see them.”

“Really?” whispered Annie.

She and Jack peered around at the quiet forest. Jack felt unseen eyes watching them.

“Let’s hurry and find the special thing,” whispered Annie.

“How will we know when we find it?” Jack said.

“I think we’ll just know,” said Annie. She headed off through the gloom.

Jack followed. They crept between the huge tree and past handing vines.

Annie stopped. “Wait——what’s that?”

“What’s what?”

“Listen——that weird sound.”

Jack listened. He heard a crackling sound.

It sounded like a person walking over leaves.

Jack looked around. He didn’t see anymore.

But the sound got louder.

Was it an animal? A giant bug? One that had never been named?

Just then the silent forest came alive.

Birds took off into the air. Frogs hopped over the leaves. Lizards ran up the tree trunks.

The weird noise grew louder and louder.

“Maybe the book explains it,” said Jack. He opened the book. He found a picture of different animals running together. He read:

​		When animals hear a creackling sound, they flee in panic. The sound means that 30 million 		

​		felsh-eating army ants are marching through the dead leaves.

“It’s army anys!” cried Jack. “Millions of them!”

“Where?” cried Annie.

Jack and Annie looked around wildly.

“There!” Annie pointed.

Army ants——millions and millions of them were marching over the leaves!

“Run to the tree house!” cried Annie.

“Where is it?” said Jack. whirling around. All the trees looked the same. Where was the rope ladder?

“Just run!” cried Annie.

Jack and Annie took off.

They ran over the dead leaves.

They ran between wide tree trunks.

They ran past the handing vines and mosses.

They climbed over thick roots.

Jack saw a clearing ahead. It was filled with sunlight.

“That way!” he cried.

Jack and Annie hurried toward the light. They pushed their way through the bushes.

They burst onto the bank of a river.

They stared at the slow-moving brown water.

“Do you think the ants will come this way?” Annie said, panting.

“I don’t know,” said Jack. “But if we wade a few feet into the river, we’re safe. The ants won’t go into the water. Come on.”

“Look!” said Annie.

She point to a big log rocking at the edge of the river. The inside of the log was dug out.

“It looks like a canoe,” said Jack. he listened to the crackling sound in the distance. “Let’s get in it. Quick!”

Jack shoved the book into his backpack. Then he and Annie carefully climbed into the dug-out log.

Annie leaned out of it. She pushed away from the bank with her hands.

“Wait!” said Jack. “We don’t have paddles!”

“Oops,” said Annie.

The canoe started moving slowly down the muddy river.



## 5：Pretty Fish

Squeak.

Annie patted the little mouse in her pocket.

“It’s okay, Peanut. The ants can’t get us in the river. We’re safe,” she said.

“Maybe safe from the ants,” said Jack.

“But where is this canoe going?”

Jack and Annie stared at the river. Branches spread over the water. Vines and mosses hung down from them.

“We’d better look this up,” said Jack. He pulled the rain forest book out of his backpack and flipped through it.

Soon he found a picture of a river. He read:

​		The Amazon River stretches over 4000 miles from the mountains of Peru, across Brazil, to the Atlantic Ocean. The river basin contains over half of the rain forests in the world.

Jack looked at Annie. “We’re on the Amazon River,” he said. “It’s more than four thousand miles long!”

“Wow,” Annie whispered. She looked at the river. She trailed her hand through the water.

“I have to make some notes——” Jack said.

He pulled his notebook out of his pack. He wrote:

​	The Amazon  rain forest is

“Jack, look at those pertty fish with the teeth,” said Annie.

“What?” Jack glanced up from his writing.

Annie was pointing at some blue fish swimming near the boat. The fish had red bellies and razor-sharp teeth.

“Watch it!” cried Jack. “Those aren’t pretty fish. They’re piranhas! They’ll eat anything! Even people!”

“Yiles,” whispered Annie.

“We better get back on shore,” said Jack, putting the books in his backpack.

“How?” said Annie. “We can’t go in the water now. And we don’t have any paddles.”

Jack tried to stay calm. “We need a plan,” he said.

Jack stared at the river. The canoe would soon float under some vines.

“I’ll grab a vine,” said Jack. “And pull us to shore.”

“Good idea,” said Annie.

As they glided under the branches, Jack stood up.

The canoe rocked. he nearly fell out.

“Balance the canoe,” said Jack.

Annie leaned to one side. Jack reached——he missed!

The canoe float under more branches.

Jack reached for another thick vine.

He grabbed it!

It was cold and scaly. It wiggled and jerked.

“Ahhh!” Jack screamed and fell back into the canoe.

The vine was alive!

It was a long green snake!

The snake fell from the tree. It splashed into the water and swam away.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

He and Annie stared in horror at each other.

“What now?” said Annie, making a face.

“Well...” Jack looked at the river. There were no vines up ahead. But there was a big branch floating on the water.

“Grab that branch near you,” said Jack. “Maybe we can use it for a paddle.”

The canoe floated closer to the branch. Annie reached for it.

Suddenly the branch rose into the air!

It was a crocodile!

“Help!” screamed Annie, and she fell back into the canoe.

The crocodile opened and closed its huge, long jaws, Then it moved past the canoe and swam up the river.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack.

A screeching sound split the air.

Jack and Annie jumped.

“Help!” said Jack.

He expected to see another terrible creature.

But all he saw was a small brown monkey, hanging by its tail from a tree.



## 6：Monkey Trouble

Squeak! Squeak! Peanut poked her head out from Annie’s pocket. She seemed to be yelling at the monkey.

“Don’t worry.” Peanut,” said Annie. “ He’s just a little monkey. He won’t hurt us.”

But suddenly the monkey grabbed a big red fruit hanging from the tree. He hurled it at the canoe.

“Watch it!” shouted Jack.

The fruit fell into the water with a splash.

The monkey screeched even louder.

He grabbed another fruit.

“Don’t throw things at us!” shouted Annie.

But the monkey hurld the red fruit right at them.

Jack and Annie ducked again. And the fruit splashed into the water.

“Stop that!” Annie shouted.

But the monkey only waved his arms and screeched again.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. “I don’t believe this.”

The monkey grabbed a third fruit and hurld it at Jack and Annie. It landed inside the canoe with a thump.

Annie grabbed the fruit. She stood up and threw it back at the monkey.

 She missed. The canoe rocked. Annie almost fell out. 

The monkey screeched even louder.

“Go away!” Annie shouted. “You’re the meanest thing in the world.”

The monkey stopped screeching.

He looked at Annie. Then he swung away. Into the forest.

“I think I hurt his feelings,” said Annie.

“Who cares?” said Jack. “He shouldn’t throw things.”

“Uh-oh,” said Annie. “It’s raining now.”

“What?” Jack looked up. A raindrop hit him in the eye.

“Oh, on. I don’t believe this,” Jack said.

“What’d you expect?” said Annie. “It is the rain forest.”

A gust of wind blew the canoe.

Thunder rolled in the sky.

“A river’s a had place to be in a strom,” said. “We have to get back to shore. Right now.”

“But how?” said Annie. “We can’t wade or swim. The piranhas, the snake, and the crocodile will get us.”

Screeching split the air again.

“Oh, no,” said Jack. The bratty monkey was back.

This time, the monkey was pointing a long stick at the canoe.

Jack crouched down. Was the monkey going to hurl the stick at them? Like a spear?

Annie jumped up and faced the monkey.

“Watch it! He’s nuts,” said Jack.

But monkey just stared at Annie. And Annie just stared back at tim.

After a long moment, the monkey seemed to smile. 

Annie smiled back.

“What’s going on?” siad Jack.

“He wants to help us,” Annie said.

“Help us how?” said Jack.

The monkey held out the long stick.

Annie grabbed the other end.

The monkey pulled on the stick. The canoe started floating toward him.

The monkey pulled the canoe all the way to the bank of the river.



## 7：Freeze!

Jack and Annie jumped out of the canoe.

The rain was starting to fall harder.

The monkey took off. He swung from tree to tree, heading up the riverbank.

He screeched and beckoned to Jack and Annie.

“He wants us to follow him!” said Annie.

“No! We have to find the special thing Then go home!”  said Jack.

“He wants to help us!” said Annie. She took off after the monkey.

The two of them vanished into the rain forest.

“Annie!”

Thunder shook the sky.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

He dashed after Annie and the monkey. Into the dark forest.

The forest seemed surprising ly dry.

Jack looked up. It was still raining. But the treetops acted like a huge umbrella.

“Annie?” called Jack.

“Jack! Jack!” cried Annie.

“where are you?”

“Here!”

Jack hurried in the direction of Annie’s voice.

Soon he found the monkey. He was screeching and swinging from a tree.

Annie was kneeling on the forest floor. She was playing with an animal that looked like a giant kitten.

“What’s that?” Jack said.

“I don’t know,” but I love it!” said Annie.

Annie batted the animal’s paws. It had gold fur and balck spots.

“I’d better find out what it is,” said Jack. He pulled out the rain forest book and flipped through it.

“Oh, it’s so cute,” said Annie.

Jack found a picture of an animal with gold fur and black spots. He read:

​		The jaguar is the biggest predator in the western hemisphere.

“Forget cute,” Jack said. “That must be a baby jaguar. It’s going to grow up and be the biggest predator in——”

“What’s a predator?” asked Annie.

GRRR! There was a terrible growl.

Jack whirled around.

The mother jaguar was coming out from behind a tree. She was creeping over the dead leaves——right toward Annie.

“Freeze!” whispered Jack.

Annie froze. But the jaguar kept moving slowly toward her.

“Help,” said Jack weakly.

Suddenly the monkey swooped down from his tree. He grabbed the jaguar’s tail.

The cat roared and spun around.

Annie jumped up.

The monkey pulled the jaguar’s tail again. Then he let go and took off.

The jaguar sprang after him.

“Run, Annie!” cried Jack.

Jack and Annie took off through the rain forest. They ran for their lives!



## 8：Vampire Bats?

“Wait——” said Jack, panting. “I think we got away.”

Jack and Annie stopped running and caught their breath.

“Where are we?” said Jack.

“Where’s the monkey?” said Annie, looking back at the forest. “Do yo think the jaguar caught him?”

“No, monkets are fast,” said Jack.

Of course, jaguar are fast, too, Jack thought. But he didn’t want to tell Annie that.

“I hope he’s akay,” said Annie.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of Annie’s pocket.

“Peanut! I almost forget you!” said Annie. “Are you okay?”

The mouse just stared at Annie with her big eyes.

“She looks scared,” said Jack. “Poor Peanut.”

“Poor monkey,” said Annie. She looked around at the forest.

“We’d better check the book,” Jack said.

He pulled out the book. He turned the pages, searching for help.

He stopped at a picture of a scary creature.

“Oh, man. What’s this?” he said.

Jack read the write below the picture. It said:

​		Vampirc bats live in the Amazon rain forest. At night, they quietly bite their victims and suck their 

​		blood.

“Vampire bats?” said Jack. He felt faint.

“Vampire bats?” said Annie.

Jack nodded. “After dark.”

Annie and Jack looked around. The rain forest seemed to be getting even darker.

“Yikes,” said Annie. She looked at Jack. “Maybe we should go home.”

Jack nodded. For once he agreed with her.

“But what about our mission?” said Annie. “What about Morgan?”

“W’ll come back,” said Jack. “We’ll have to be prepared.”

“So we’ll come back tomorrow?” Annie asked.

“Right. Now which way is the tree house?” said Jack.

“This way,” said Annie , pointing.

“That way,” said Jack, pointing in the opposite direction.

They looked at each other. “We’re lost,” They said together.

Squeak.

“Don’t worry, Peanut.” Annie started to pat the mouse again. But then she stopped.

Squeak. Squeak. Squeak.

“Jack, I think Peanut wants to help us,” said Annie.

“How?”

“The way she helped us in the time of ninjas——”

Annie placed the mouse on the leafy forest floor. “Take us to the tree house, Peanut.”

The mouse took off.

“Where’d she go?” said Annie. “I don’t see her!”

“There!” said Jack. He pointed to leaves rusting on the ground.

A streak of white passed over leaves.

“Yes, there!” said Annie.

Jack and Annie followed the moving leaves. The streak of white appeared. And disappeared.

Suddenly Jack stopped.

The forest floor was still. There was no sign of Peanut.

“Where is she?” asked Jack.

He kept staring at the ground.

“Jack!”

Jack glanced around. Annie was standing on the other side of a nearby tree. She was pointing up.

Jack looked up.

The tree house.

“Or, whew,” Jack said softly,

“She saved us again,” said Annie. “She’s running up the ladder. All by herself. Look.”

Annie pointed at the rope ladder.

Peanut was climbing up one of the ropes.

“Let’s go,” Jack said.

Annie started up the ladder. Then Jack.

They followed Peanut all the way up to the canopy of the rain forest.



## 9：The Thing

Jack and Annie climbed into the tree house.

Peanut was sitting on a stack of books.

Annie patted Peanut’s little head. “Thanks,” she said softly.

“I have to write some notes about the rain forest,” said Jack. “You find the Pennsylvania book.”

Annie began searching for the Pennsylvania book——the book that always took them home.

Jack pulled out his notebook.

He had wanted to take lots of notes here. But all he’d written so far was:

​	The Amazon rain forest is

“It’s not here!” said Annie.

“What?” Jack looked up. He glanced around the tree house.

Annie was right. The Pennsylavanis book was nowhere in sight.

“Was it here before we left home?” said Jack.

“I don’t remember,” said Annie.

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “Now we can’t get back to Frog Creek.”

“That means we’ll be here when the vampire bats come out,” said Annie.

Something came flying through the tree house window. 

“Ahhh!” Jack and Annie hid their heads.

Thud.

Something hit the floor. A red fruit.

Jack looked up. The monkey was sitting in the window. His head was cocked to one side. He seemed to be grinning at them.

“You’re safe!” said Annie.

“Thanks for saving us,” said Jack.

The monkey just grinned.

“I have just one question,” said Annie. She pointed at the fruit. “Why do you keep throwing those at us?”

The monkey grabbed the fruit.

“No! Don’t throw it!” said Jack. He ducked.

But the monkey didn’t throw the fruit.

He held it out to Annie. He moved his lips as if he were trying to say something.

 Annie stared into the monkey’s eyes. He moved his lips again.

“Wow,” Annie siad softly. “I understand now.”

“Underdtand what?” said Jack.

Annie took the fruit from the monkey. “This is it,” she said. “The thing we need.”

“What thing?” said Jack.

“One of the special things we’re supposed to find for Morgan,” Annie said. “To free her from the spell.”

“Are you sure?” said Jack.

Before Annie could answer, Jack saw the Pennsylvania book. “Look! Our book!” he said, pointing.

“We found the thing. And now we can see the book,” said Annie. “That’s the way it words, remember?”

Jack nodded. Now he remembered. The ninja master said they wouldn’t be able to find the Pennsylvania book until they had found what they were looking for.

The monkey screeched with laughter.

Jack and Annie looked at him. He was clapping his hand together.

Annie laughed with him. “How did you know to give this to us?” she said. “Who told you to do that?”

The monkey just waved at Jack and Annie. Then he turned and swung away out of the tree house.

“Wait!” said Jack, looking out the window.

Too late.

The monkey was gone. He had vanished below the treetops.

“Good-bye!” called Annie.

A happy screech came from the mysterious world below.

Jack sighed. He picked up his notebook again. He looked at his writing:

​		The Amazon rain forest is

He had to write something before they left. he quickly added——

​		amazing

Jack put away his notebook. Annie picked up the Pennsylvania book.

“Now it’s really time to leave,” she said.

She turned to the picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there,” she said, pointing at the picture.

The wind started to blow.

The leaves began to tremble.

The tree house began to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Halfway There

Squeak.

Jack opened his eyes. Peanut was on the tree house windowsill.

“We’re home,” said Annie.

Jack breathed a sigh of relief.

Annie held the fruit up to the afternoon light.

“What exactly  is this?” she asked.

“Maybe it’s in the book,” Jack answered.

He pulled out the rain forest book. He flipped through the pages. He came to a picture of the red fruit.

“Here it is!” he said. He read out loud:

​		“The mango has a sweet taste like that of a peach.”

“Mango? Hmmm,” said Annie. She brought the fruit close to her lips.

“Hey!” said Jack, grabbing the mango from her. “We have to put it with the moonstone.”

Jack placed the mango on the M carved into the floor. Next to the clear moonshone.

“Moonstone...mango,” whispered Annie. It sounded like a spell.

“We’re halfway there,” said Jack. “Two more to go.”

“Then we can free you, Morgan!” Annie called, as if Morgan were nearby.

“How do you know she can hear you?” said Jack.

“I just feel it,” Annie said.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He needed more proof than that.

Squeak. Peanut was looking at Jack and Annie.

“We have to leave you now,” Jack said to the mouse.

Squeak.

“Can’t we take her with us?” said Annie.

“No,” said Jack. “Mon won’t let us keep a mouse in the house. She doesn’t like mice remember?”

“How could anyone not like a mouse?” said Annie.

Jack smiled. “How could anyone not like a spider?” he said.

“That’s different.” Annie patted Peanut’s head. “Bye,” she said. “Wait for us here. We’ll be back tomorrom.”

Jack patted the mouse too. “Bye, Peanut. Thanks for your help,” he said.

Squeak.

Jack put the rain forest book on top of the book about ninjas.

Then he pulled on his backpack. And he and Annie left the tree house.

They climbed down the rope ladder. They stepped onto the ground.

They started walking through the Frog Creek woods.

Leaf shadows danced in the light.

A bird called out.

These woods are very different from the rain forest, Jack thought.

“There’re no jaguars or army ants here,” he said. “No little monkeys.”

“You know, that monkey was never being mean,” said Annie. “He was just trying to give us the mango.”

“I know. Actually, nothing was being mean,” said Jack. “The army ants were just marching. That’s what army ants do.”

“The piranhas were just being piranhas.” said Annie.

“The snake was just being a snake,” said Jack.

“The crocodile was just being a crocodile.” said Annie.

“The jaguar was just taking care of her baby, ” said Jack.

Annie shuddered. “I still don’t love bugs,” she said.

“You don’t have to love them,” said Jack. “Just leave them alone. And they won’t bother you.”

In fact, that’s true about the whole rain forest, Jack thought. Everyone should just leave it all alone.

“Who cares if the bugs don’t have names?” he said softly. “They know who they are.”

Jack and Annie stepped out of the Frog Creek woods.

They started walking up their street. It was lit with golden light.

“Race you!” said Annie.

They took off runnung.

They ran across their yard.

They raced up their steps.

“Safe!” they shouted together, tagging their front door.





# Sunset of the Sabertooth

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house.They found it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Jack and Annie visited dinosaurs, knights, an Egyptian queen, pirates, ninjas, and the Amazon rain forest.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian. She traveled through time and space, gathering books for King Arthur's library.

On their fifth adventure, in Night of the Ninjas, Jack and Annie found a little mouse in the tree house. Annie named their new friend “Peanut.”

Now Jack and Annie and Peanut are about to set out in search of the third thing...in Sunset ofthe Sabertooth.

Jack and Annie also found a note from Morgan. The note told them that she was under a spell. To free her, Jack and Annie must find four special things.

They found the first thing in old Japan,and the second in the Amazon rain forest.

Now Jack and Annie and Peanut are about to set out in search of the third thing... in Sunset of the Sabertooth



## The “M” Things

“Let's go to the tree house," said Annie. 

She and Jack were passing the Frog Creek woods on their way home from their swimming class at the Y.

No. I want to go home and change out of my bathing suit," said Jack.

“Oh, that’ll take too long,” said Annie. “Don't you want to save Morgan as soon as possible?”

“Of course,”said Jack.

Then come on! Before the sun sets!" said Annie.

She darted into the woods.

Jack sighed. He gave up on the idea of changing out of his bathing suit.

He pushed his glasses into place. He followed Annie into the Frog Creek woods.

The warm air smelled fresh and green. 

He moved through patches of sunlight and shadow. Soon he came to a small clearing.

He looked up. There it was. The magic tree house in the tallest tree in the woods.

“Hurry!” called Annie. She was climbing the rope ladder up to the tree house.

Jack grabbed the ladder. He started up after her.

Finally they reached the tree house.

Squeak. A mouse sat on the window sill.

Hi Peanut!”cried Annie.

Jack patted the tiny head.

Sorry we didn't come sooner," Annie said “But we had to go to our swimming lesson.”

Squeak.

“What happened while we were gone? asked Annie, looking around the tree house. Jack stared at the large M carved into the wooden floor.

On the M were a moonstone and a mango.the special things they'd found on their last two journeys.

“Hey, guess what?” said Jack. “Moonstone and mango start with the letter M. Just like Morgan”

“You're right" said Annie.

“I bet all four things start with an M" said Jack.

“Right," said Annie. “I wonder where we'll find the next one."

She and Jack stared at the stacks of books in the tree house. Books on the Amazon rainforest, ninjas, pirates, mummies, knights, and dinosaurs.

All of them were closed. Only one book lay open in the corner.

We're just about to find out," said Jack.

They walked over to the open book.

They looked at the page the book was opened to. It showed a picture of rocks and snow.

“Wow,” said Annie, running her finger over the picture. “I love snow. I wish we could go there right now.”

“Wait,” said Jack. "We're not prepared. "Then he had another thought. “And we're wearing our bathing suits! Stop!”

“Oops," said Annie.

Too late. The wind started to blow.

The leaves started to shake.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster!

Then everything was silent.

It was as silent as the falling snow.



## 2：Bones

Jack, Annie, and Peanut looked outside.

Snow was falling from a gray sky.

The tree house was in the tallest tree in a grove of tall, bare trees.

The grove was on a wide, white plain.

Beyond the plain were high, rocky cliffs.

“I'm c-cold" said Annie. Her teeth chattered. She wrapped her towel tightly around her.

Sq-squeak. Peannt sounded cold too.

“Poor mouse” said Annie, “I’Il put you into Jack's pack. You’ll be warmer there."

Annie slipped Peanut into the pocket of the backpack.

We have to go home,” said Jack. “We need warmer clothes.”

“We can't go home" said Annie. “We can't find the Pennsylvania book. Not until our mission is complete. Remember? That's the way the magic works."

“Oh...right,” said Jack. He looked around. There was no sign of the Pennsylvania book that always took them home.

Annie peered out the window again. Where are we, anyway?" she asked.

“I'll find out," said Jack. He picked up the open book and read the title on the cover. “Life in the Ice Age"

“Ice Age?” said Annie." No wonder we're cold.

“We better find the third M thing soon," said Jack. “Before we freeze to death."

“Look” whispered Annie, “people.” She pointed out the window.

Jack saw them, too: four figures on a cliff. Two big figures and two little ones——all holding long spears.

Who are they?” said Annie.

“I'll look in the book" said Jack。

He found a picture of some people. He read the caption to Annie:

​		Early modern humans were called Cro-Magnons During the late Ice Age in
​		Europe, they sometimes lived in caves beneath cliffs.

Why are they carrying spears?” said Annie.

Jack turned the page. He found another picture of the Cro-Magnons. He read aloud:

​		The Cro-Magnon family often hunted together. They covered deep pits with
​		branches. Then they drove reindeer and mammoths into the traps.

“Oh, trapping the animals——that's sad,” said Annie.

“No, it's not," said Jack. “They couldn't live without hunting. They didn't have supermarkets, you know."

They watched the family disappear over the other side of the cliff.

“Come on, I'm freezing," said Jack. “Let's hurry and find the M thing while the Cro-Magnons are hunting.”

“But I want to meet them," said Annie.

“Forget it,” said Jack. “They don't have books that tell them about us. They'll think we're some enemy and hurl their spears."

“Yikes” said Annie.

Jack put his book away.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of the backpack.

“Stay in there"said Annie.

Jack pulled on his pack and started down the rope ladder.

Annie followed.

On the icy ground, they huddled together.

The wind was biting. Jack put his towel over his head. Snow blew against his glasses. 

“Hey, Jack," said Annie. “Look at me."

Annie had put on her swimming goggles. “Now I can see," she said.

“Good thinking,” said Jack. “Now cover your head with your towel. Most of your body heat is lost through your head."

Annie wrapped her towel around her head.

We should find a cave or someplace warmer" said Jack.

“I bet there are caves in those cliffs," said Annie.

She and Jack started across the white plain. The snow wasn't deep yet. But the wind was blowing hard.

“I told you!” Annie pointed to an opening in the rocks--a cave.

They ran to it.

“Careful,” said Jack. They stepped carefully into the shadowy cave.

It was only slightly warmer inside. But at least the wind wasn't blowing.

In the gray light, they stamped the snow off their sneakers.

Annie took off her goggles.

“It smells in here," said Jack.

Yeah, like a wet dog" said Annie.

“Let me see what I can find out," said Jack.

He pulled out the Ice Age book.

“I'll look around” said Annie. “Maybe the M thing is here. Then we can go home and get warm."

Jack stood by the entrance so he could read the book.

“This cave is filled with sticks,” Annie said

“What?” said Jack. He didn't look up from the book.

“No, wait. I think they're bones,” said Annie.

“Bones?” echoed Jack.

“Yeah. Lots of them back here. All over the floor"

Jack turned the pages of his book. He found a picture of a cave filled with bones.

“I hear something," said Annie.

Jack read the writing below the picture of the cave. It said:

​		The great cave bears of the Ice Age were over eight feet tall. These bears were larger and fiercer 		than today's grizzlies. Their caves were filled with the bones of their ancestors.

“Annie!”whispered Jack. "Get back here now!

They were in the cave of a great cave bear!



## 3：Brrr!

“Annie!” whispered Jack again.

No answer.

He put his book quietly into his pack. He stepped deeper into the cave.

“Annie!" he said a little louder.

Jack stepped on the bones.

The wet dog smell grew stronger.

He kept going, deeper into the smelly blackness.

He ran into something. He gasped.

“Jack?” said Annie. “Is that you?"

“Didn't you hear me calling?” Jack whispered. “We have to get out of here!”

“Wait” she said.“ Someone's sleeping back there. Hear him snoring?"

Jack heard a low, deep moaning. It was loud, then soft. Loud, then soft.

“That's not a person," he said. “It's a great cave bear!”

A booming snore shattered the air.

yikes!” said Annie

“Go! Go!" said Jack.

He and Annie ran through the cave, over the bones, and out into the falling snow.

They kept on going. They ran between fallen rocks and under jagged cliffs.

Finally they stopped and turned around.

All they could see was snow and rocks and their own footprints.

No bear.

Whew” said Annie.“That was lucky.

"Yeah” said Jack. “He probably never even woke up. We just got in a panic."

Annie huddled close to Jack. “Brrr! I'm f-freezing," she said.

“Me too,” he said.

He took off his glasses to wipe off the snow. The cold wind blew against his bare legs.

”Wow,” Annie said. “Look.” She pointed to something behind Jack.

“What?” Jack put his glasses back on and turned around.

Under a cliff was a wide ledge. Under the ledge was another cave.

Only this cave seemed to have a golden glow.

This one looked cozy and safe and warm.



## 4：Gave Kids





Jack and Annie crept to the cave and peeked inside.

A small flame danced from a bed of glowing coals.

Near the fire were knives, axes, and hollowed-out stones.

Animal skins were neatly stacked against the wall.

“People must live here" said Annie.

Maybe it's the home of the Cro-Magnons we saw," said Jack, looking around.

“Let's go inside and get warm,” said Annie.

Jack and Annie moved quickly to the fire and warmed their hands.

Their shadows danced on the stone walls.

Jack pulled out his Ice Age book. He found a picture of a cave. He read:

​				Cro-Magnons made many things from 
​				animals plants and stone. They made 		
​				flute-like musical instruments from 
​				mammoth bones They made ropes by
​				braiding plant fibers. They made axes 
​				and knives from stone.

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencilHe started a list:

​			Cro. Mognons made:
​			bone fiutes
​			plant ropes
​			sfone axes and knives

Ta-da!” said Annie.

Jack looked up. Annie was wearing a coat. It had a hood and long sleeves. It went all the way down to her sneakers.

Where did you get that?" said Jack.

“From that pile of furry skins,” said Annie, pointing. “These must be their clothes. Maybe they're being mended."

She picked up another coat and handed it to Jack.

“Try one. It's really warm," she said.

Jack put his backpack and towel down on the hard dirt floor. He slipped on the coat.

It did feel very warm --and soft.

We look like cave kids," said Annie.

Squeak. Peanut peeked out of Jack's pack lying on the floor.

“You stay in there,” said Annie. “There's no teeny coat for you."

Peanut vanished back into the pack.

“I wonder how they made these coats," said Jack.

He turned the pages in the book until he found a picture of Cro-Magnon women sewing. He read:

​		Cro-Magnons scraped reindeer skin with flint rocks to make them soft.
​		They used bone needles to sew the skins together for clothing.

Jack added to his list:

​		reindeer-skin clothes

“I hope the cave people won't mind if we borrow their coats" said Jack.

“Maybe we should give them our towels," said Annie. “To thank them."

“Good idea”

“And my goggles, too," said Annie.

They left their gifts on top of the rest of the animal skins.

“Let's explore the cave before they come home" said Jack.

“It's too dark in the back" said Annie. We won't be able to see anything."

“I’Il find out how Cro-Magnons saw in the dark" said Jack.

He opened the Ice Age book. He found a picture of cave people holding odd-looking lamps. He read aloud to Annie:

​			Cro-Magnons made stone lamps. They hollowed out a rock, filled it with animal fat, then burned 			a wick made from moss.

There!” said Annie. She pointed to two stones near the fire. In the hollow of each was gooey white stuff and a pile of moss.

We have to be careful, said Jack. 

He picked up one stone. It was smaller than a soup bowl, but much heavier.

Jack held the stone close to the fire and lit the piece of moss.

He lit another lamp and gave it to Annie.

“Carry it with two hands," he said.

“I know" she said.

Jack tucked the book under his arm. He and Annie carried their stone lamps to the back of the cave.

“Hey, I wonder where this goes,” said Annie. She held her lamp up to an opening in the wall.

“I’ll check in the book" said Jack.

He put down his lamp and flipped through the Ice Age book.

“I think it's a tunnel," she said. "Be right back."”

"Wait a second,” said Jack.

Too late——she had squeezed into the opening and was gone.

“Oh brother," said Jack, sighing. He closed his book and peeked into the opening.

“Come back here!” he said.

“No! You come here!" said Annie. Her voice

sounded far away."You won't believe this!”Jack picked up his lamp and book. Heducked into a small tunnel.
”Wow!" came Annie's voice sounded far away. “You won’t believe this!”

Jack picked up his lamp and book. He ducked into a small tunnel.

“Wow!” came Annie’s voice.

Jack could see her lamp flickering at the other end.

Crouching down, he hurried toward her. At the end of the tunnel was a huge cavern with a high ceiling.

Annie held her lamp close to the wall. 

“Look," she said. Her voice echoed. 

Animals were painted on the wall in strokes of red and black and yellow.

There were cave bears and lions, elk and reindeer, bison and woolly rhinos and mammoths.

In the flickering light, the prehistoric beasts looked alive.



## 5：Snow Tracks

“Wow, what is this place?” said Jack.

“Maybe it’s an art gallery,” said Annie.

“I don’t think so,” said Jack. “It’s too hard to get to.”

He read about the cave paintings:

​		These Ice Age beasts were painted 25000 year age. Cro-Magonos painted picture of animals they 		hunted. They may have believed the paintings would give them power over the animals.

“Wow, look at this,” said Annie.

She pointed at a painting farther down the wall.

It showed a figure with human arms and legs, reindeer antlers, and an owl face. It seemed to be holding a flute.

Jack looked at the book again. He found a picture of the figure and read:

​		 Cave men may have been led by a sorcerer, or “Master of the Animals.” He may have worn 				reindeer antlers so the could run like a reindeer——and an owl mask so he could see like an owl.

 “What is it?" said Annie.

The Master of the Animals," said Jack. “He's a sorcerer."

“Oh wow!” breathed Annie. “That's it."

“That's what?”

“That's who we have to find."

“Why?”

“Maybe he's a friend of Morgan's,” said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly. “Maybe," he said.

“Let's go find him," said Annie.

They went back through the tunnel into the first cave.

We better put our lamps back," said Jack.

He and Annie blew out their lamps.

They placed them back by the fire.

Jack's backpack was on the floor next to the skins. He put the Ice Age book into it.

How's Peanut?" said Annie.

Jack looked into his pack." She's not here," he said.

“Oh no!” cried Annie. “She must have crawled out when we were looking at the paintings.”

“Peanut!” Jack called.

“Peanut!” called Annie.

Annie walked slowly around the cave, looking into the shadows.

Jack peered around the fire and under each of the furry skins.

“Jack! Come here!” said Annie.

She was standing near the entrance to the cave.

The snow had stopped falling.

In the snow were tiny tracks.



## 6：Song on the wind

“Peanut's tracks,” said Annie. “We have to find her before she freezes."

She wrapped her reindeer coat around her and headed across the snow.

Jack pulled on his backpack and followed.

The mouse's tracks led them between the fallen rocks and back onto the open plain.

The wind blew harder. Snow swirled over the ground, covering the tiny footprints.

“I can't see them anymore!” wailed Annie.

She and Jack now stood in the middle of the plain. They stared at the windswept snow.

The mouse's tracks had vanished.

“Yikes” whispered Annie, staring up.

Jack followed her gaze. On one of the cliffs was a tiger. A giant tiger with two long, sharp fangs.

“A sabertooth" said Jack.

“I hope he doesn't see us,” whispered Annie.

“Me too,” Jack whispered back. “We'd better head back to the tree house."”

Jack and Annie stepped very softly across the snow. Then Jack glanced back at the cliff.

The sabertooth was gone.

“Oh man" he said. “Where is he?

”Run to the trees!" said Annie.

He and Annie started running. They ran over the snowy plain, heading toward the tall bare trees in the distance.
Suddenly Jack heard a crack.

The ground caved in, and Jack went with it.

Annie fell beside him.

They crashed down onto a heap of branches, snow, and earth.

They struggled to stand. Jack pushed his glasses into place.

“You all right?" he asked Annie.

“Yes," she said.

They both looked up. They were in a deephole. All Jack could see were gray clouds moving over head.

“This is a trap” Jack said. “The Cro-Magnons must have put branches over this hole. Then the snow hid the branches. So we didn't see them."

“There's no way out," said Annie.

She was right. They were helpless. The pit was too deep to climb out of.

“I feel like a trapped animal,” Annie said.

“Me too," said Jack.

He heard a yowl in the distance.

The sabertooth!” whispered Annie.

Jack pulled out the Ice Age book. He found a picture of the sabertooth. He read:

​			The sabertooth was the fiercest beast of the Ice Age. It attacked humans as well as woolly 

​			mammoths and other large animals.

“Oh brother" said Jack.

“Listen!” Annie grabbed him. 

“What?” Jack jumped.

“I hear music."

Jack listened. But all he heard was the wind.

You hear it?” said Annie.

“No” said Jack.

“Listen carefully.”

He closed his eyes. He listened very care-ully.

He heard the wind. But this time he heard another sound, too.

Strange, haunting music.

“Ahhh!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

Staring down at them was a figure wearing reindeer antlers and an owl mask.

The sorcerer,” whispered Jack.

Squeak.

Peanut peered down at them, too!



## 7：The Sorcerer's Gift

The sorcerer didn't speak. He stared through the eyeholes of the owl mask.

Help us, please” said Annie.

The sorcerer threw a rope into the pit. Jack grabbed it.

“He wants to pull us up,” said Annie.

Jack looked up. The sorcerer was gone.

Where did he go?" Jack said.

Tug on the rope," said Annie.

Jack tugged. The rope tightened. It began rising.

“I'll go first!” said Annie cheerfully. 

“Annie, this isn't a game," warned Jack.

“Don't worry, I’ll be careful."

Jack gave her the rope. “Okay. But hold on tight," he said.

Annie held the rope with both hands. She pushed her feet against the side of the pit.She rose into the air with the rope.

She kept pressing against the side of the pit——until she reached the top.

Jack saw the sorcerer reappear and help Annie up. Then they moved out of sight.

Jack was puzzled. The sorcerer had used both hands to help Annie. So who held the other end of the rope?

Wow!" came Annie's voice.

What's going on? Jack wondered.

The sorcerer came back and threw the rope down again.

Jack grabbed it. And the rope started to rise.

Jack held on tight. He started up. His hands burned. His arms felt as if they were being pulled out of their sockets.

But he kept his hold on the rope and his feet against the side of the pit.

At the top the sorcerer pulled Jack on to the snowy ground.

“Thanks,” said Jack, standing.

The sorcerer was tall. He wore a long fur robe. Jack could see only his eyes through the owl mask.

“Hey!” Annie called.

Jack turned.

Annie was sitting on a woolly mammoth.

Squeak. Peanut was sitting on the mammoth's head.

The mammoth looked like a giant elephant with shaggy reddish hair and long, curved tusks.

The other end of the rope was around the mammoth's huge neck.

Lulu pulled us up," said Annie.

“Lulu?” said Jack.

“Don't you think she looks like a Lulu?” said Annie.

“Oh brother”said Jack. He walked up to the mammoth.

“Hey, mammoth starts with M” said Annie. "Maybe Lulu's the special thing!”

“I don't think so,” said Jack.

The great creature knelt down, just like a circus elephant.

“Whoa!” said Annie. She clutched  the mammoth's ears to keep from falling off.

The sorcerer helped Jack climb onto the mammoth.

Thanks,"said Jack.

Then the sorcerer reached into a pouch. He pulled out a smooth white bone and handed it to Jack.

The bone was hollow. It had four holes along one side. And two on the other.

“Oh man, I think it's his flute," said Jack. “The book said they make flutes from mammoth bones.”

Jack tried to give the flute back to the sorcerer.

“Nice," he said politely.

But the sorcerer held up his hand.

“He wants you to keep the mammoth bone,” said Annie.

“Mammoth bone,” whispered Jack. “Hey, maybe this is the third thing."

Jack looked at the sorcerer. “Do you know Morgan?" he asked.

The sorcerer did not answer. But his eyes sparkled with kindness.

He turned away from Jack and untied the mammoth's rope. Then he whispered in the ear of the giant woolly creature.

When the mammoth stood up, Jack gripped Annie's coat to keep from falling off. He felt miles above the ground.

He nestled behind Annie, in the dip between the mammoth's head and huge curved back.

The mammoth took slow, plodding steps across the snow, then picked up speed.

Where are we going?” said Jack as they bumped up and down.

To the tree house!" said Annie.

“How does he know where it is?” said Jack.

“She just knows," said Annie.

Jack looked back.

The sorcerer was standing in the snow watching them.

But at that moment the clouds parted, and the sun came out.

Jack was blinded by sunlight on the snow.He squinted to see——but the sorcerer had vanished.



## 8：The Great Parade

The huge mammoth walked across the open plain.

“Look!” said Annie. She pointed to a herd of elk in the distance. They had great, wide antlers.

“There!” said Jack as a herd of reindeer came into view. They pranced gracefully across the snow.

Then a woolly rhino joined them on the open plain. Then a bison!

The elk, reindeer, rhino, and bison moved along with them, at a distance.

They seemed to be escorting Jack and Annie back to the tree house.

The snow sparkled with sunlight.

This is a great parade, Jack thought. Fantastic.

They were getting closer and closer to the grove of tall trees.

“I told you" said Annie. “Lulu's taking us home.”

But just then the mammoth let out a cry.

All the other animals bounded off.

Peanut started to squeak.

Jack looked around.

Behind them the sabertooth was slinking across the sunlit snow!

The woolly mammoth roared and plunged forward.

Jack and Annie nearly fell off.

Jack clutched Annie. She and Peanut clutched the mammoth's shaggy hair.

The mammoth thundered wildly over the ground.

“Ahhh!”Jack and Annie yelled.

The mammoth charged to the grove of trees.

But the tiger had circled around the trees. He stood between the tallest tree and the mammoth.

They were trapped. The sabertooth began moving slowly toward the mammoth.

The woolly mammoth roared fiercely.

But Jck knew a sabertooth could kill any creature, including a mammoth.

The huge tiger’s head was down. His burning eyes were fixed on the mammoth. His long white fangs glinted in the sunlight.



## 9：Master of the Animals.



The sabertooth crept forward.

Jack stared in horror.

“Play the flute" whispered Annie.

Is she nuts? Jack thought.

Try!” said Annie.

Jack held the mammoth-bone flute to his lips. He blew.

The flute made a strange sound.

The tiger froze. He glared at Jack.

Jack's hands shook.

The tiger growled. He took another step.

The mammoth roared and stomped the ground.

“Play it!” said Annie. "Keep playing!”

Jack blew again.

The sabertooth froze again.

Jack kept blowing until he ran out of breath.

The tiger snarled.

“He's still here,” whispered Annie. “Keept up.”

Jack closed his eyes. He took a deepbreath. Then he blew as hard and as long a she could. He covered and uncovered the holes on the bone.

The music sounded strangeas if it were coming from another world.

“He's leaving!” Annie whispered.

Jack raised his eyes. The sabertooth was slinking off toward the cliffs.

“We did it!” said Annie.

Jack lowered the flute. He felt very tired.

The mammoth waved her trunk happily.

“To the tree house, Lulu," said Annie.

The woolly mammoth snorted. Then she lumbered over to the tallest tree.

From the back of the mammoth, Jack grabbed the rope ladder. He held it for Annie.

She stroked the mammoth's giant ear. “Bye, Lulu. Thank you" she said.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder. Then she started up. Peanut climbed up, too.

After they disappeared into the tree house, Jack climbed onto the ladder.

He looked back at the woolly mammoth. “Bye, girl” he said. “Go home now. And watch out for the sabertooth.”

The mammoth walked away into the sunset.

When Jack couldn't see her anymore, he started up the rope ladder. He pulled himself into the tree house.

“Ta-da!" said Annie. She handed the Pennsylvania book to Jack.

Jack smiled. Now he was positive they had found the third M thing. Their mission was complete.

“Before we leave, we have to give our coats back" said Annie.

“Oh right" said Jack.

They took off their reindeer-skin coats and dropped them to the ground.

Brrr! said Annie.“I hope the Cro-Magnon people find them."

Jack stared out the window. He wanted to take one last look at the prehistoric world.

The sun was setting behind the hills. Four people were crossing the snowy plain. It was the Cro-Magnon family.

“Hey!” shouted Annie.

“Shhh!” said Jack.

The Cro-Magnons stopped and peered in Annie and Jack's direction.

“We left your reindeer skins! Downthere!” Annie pointed to the ground.

The tallest person stepped forward and raised a spear.

“Time to go,” said Jack.

He grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He found the picture of Frog Creek and pointed at it. "I wish we could go home," he said.

“Good-bye! Good luck!” Annie called, waving out the window.

The wind started to blow. And the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：This Age

Birds sang. The air was soft and warm.

“I hope they find their coats," said Annie. 

“Me too" said Jack. He pushed his glassesinto place.

Squeak.

“Hey, you——how did you find the sorcerer?” Annie asked Peanut.

Squeak.

“It's a secret, huh?” said Annie. She.turned to Jack. “Where's the flute?"

He held up the mammoth bone. Then he placed it on the M carved into the floor. Next to the mango from the rain forest. Next to the moonstone from the time of ninjas.

“Moonstone, mango, mammoth bone...” Annie said. “We need just one more M thing. Then Morgan will be free from her spell."

“Tomorrow," said Jack.
Annie patted Peanut on the head. “Bye you," she said.

She started down the rope ladder.

Jack gathered his things.

He paused and glanced at the mouse. She stared at him with big brown eyes.

Thanks again for helping us," he said. Then he climbed down the rope ladder and jumped onto the ground.

Jack and Annie ran through the Frog Creek woods onto their street.

Their neighborhood looked rosy in the sunset.

It's great to be back in this age, Jack thought. Warm and safe and almost home.

“I'm glad we don't have to go hunting for dinner," he said.

“Yeah, Mom and Dad already did that,” said Annie, “at the supermarket."

“I hope they trapped some spaghetti and meatballs,” said Jack.

“I hope they trapped a pizza," said Annie.

“Hurry, I'm starving," said Jack. 

They ran up their sidewalk and through their front door.

“We're home!” shouted Annie.

What's for dinner?” shouted Jack.



# Midnight on the Moon

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house.

The tree house was filled with books and it was magic. It could go any place that was in abook. All Jack and Annie had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

They visited dinosaurs, knights, an Egyptian queen, pirates, ninjas, and the Amazon rain forest.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belonged to Morgan le Fay. Morgan was a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She traveled through time and space, gathering books for her library.

One day, Jack and Annie found a note that said Morgan was under a spell. Jack and Annie set out in the magic tree house to find four special things that would free her.

With the help of a mouse named Peanut, Jack and Annie found the first thing in old Japan, the second in the Amazon rain forest, and the third in the Ice Age.

Now Jack, Annie, and Peanut are ready to find the last thing...in Midnight on the Moon.



## 1：By Moonlight

“Jack!” whispered a voice.

Jack opened his eyes. He saw a figure in the moonlight.

“Wake up. Get dressed.” It was his sister Annie.

Jack turned on his lamp. He rubbed his eyes.

Annie was standing beside his bed. She wore jeans and a sweatshirt.

“Let’s go to the tree house,” she said.

What time is it?” asked Jack. He put on his glasses.

“Don't look at your clock" said Annie.

Jack looked at his clock. “Oh, man,” he said. "It's midnight. It's too dark."

“No, it isn't. The moon makes it bright enough to see" said Annie.

Wait till morning," said Jack. “No——now," said Annie. “We have to find the fourth M thing. I have a feeling that the full moon might help us.”

“That's nuts," said Jack. “I want to sleep. “

"You can sleep when we come back home.” said Annie. "No time will have passed.”

Jack sighed. "Oh, brother," he said.

But he got out of bed.

“Yay!” whispered Annie. “Meet you at the back door.” She tiptoed out of Jack's room.

Jack yawned. He pulled on his jeans and sneakers and a sweatshirt. He put his notebook and pencil into his backpack. Then he crept down the stairs.

Annie opened the back door. Quietly, they stepped outside.

“Wait_" said Jack. "We need a flashlight."

No, we don't. I told you-the moon will light our way," said Annie. And she took off.

Jack sighed, then followed her.

Annie was right, thought Jack. The moon was so bright that he could see his shadow. Everything seemed washed with silver.

Soon they left their street. Annie led the way into the Frog Creek woods, It was much darker under the shadows of the trees.

Jack looked up, searching for the tree house.

“There!”said Annie.

The magic tree house was shining in the moonlicht.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started climbing up.

"Careful-go slowly,” said Jack.

He followed her up the ladder and into the tree house.

Moonlight streamed through the window.

It shone on the letter M that shimmered on the wooden floor.

It shone on the three M things that rested on the M: a moonstone from the time of theninjas, a mango from the Amazon rain forest. and a mammoth bone from the Ice Age.

“We need just one more M thing,” said Annie, “to free Morgan from her spell."

Squeak

“Peanut!” said Annie.

In the dim light Jack saw a tiny mouse.

She sat on an open book.

“You didn't expect to see us this late, did you?" said Annie.

She picked up Peanut. And Jack picked up the open book.

So where are we going this time?” Anniea sked him.

Jack held the book up to the moonlight.

“Uh-oh” he said. "I knew we should have brought a flashlight. I can't read a thing."

He could make out diagrams and shadowy pictures. But he couldn't read a word.

"Look at the cover" said Annie.

The letters were bigger on the cover. Jack squinted at them.

“It's called Hello, Moom," he said.

Annie gasped. “We're going to the moon?”

“Of course not," said Jack. "It's impossible to go to the moon without tons of equipment.

”Why?”

“There's no air. We couldn't breathe. Not only that, we'd boil to death if it was day and freeze to death if it was night."

“Yikes," said Annie, “So where do you think we are going?”

“Maybe a place where people train to be astronauts,” said Jack.

That sounds neat" said Annie.

Yeah," said Jack. He'd always wanted to meet astronauts and space scientists.

“So say the wish, said Annie.

Jack opened the book again. He pointed to a picture of a dome-shaped structure.

“I wish we could go there," he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.As quiet and still assilence could be.



## 2：Space Motel

Jack opened his eyes.

He looked out the window. The tree house had landed inside a large white room.

What kind of training place is this?” asked Annie.

“I don't know" said Jack.

The room was round. It had no windows. It had white floors and a curved wall lit by bright lights.

”Hello!” Annie called.

There was no answer。

Where were all the astronauts and space scientists? Jack wondered.

“There's nobody here" said Annie.

“How do you know?"said Jack.

I just feel it," said Annie.

We'd better find out where we are," saidJack.

He looked at the page in the moon book. He read the words below the picture of the dome.

​			A moon base was built on the moon in the year 2031. The top of the dome slides open to let 

​			spacecrafts enter and leave.

“Oh, man——" Jack whispered.

“What's wrong?” said Annie..

Jack's heart pounded with excitement. He could hardly speak. “We've landed inside a moon base," he said.

“So...?” said Annie.

“So the moon base is on the moon!” said Jack.

Annie's eyes widened. “We're on the moon?” she asked.

Jack nodded. “The book says the moon base was built in the year 2031,” he said, “So this book was written after that! Which means this book is from the future!”

“Oh, wow” said Annie. “Morgan must have gone forward in time to borrow it from a future library."

“Right," said Jack. “And now we're in the future, on the moon."

Squeak, squeak!

Annie and Jack looked at Peanut. The mouse was running around in circles.

“Poor Peanut,” said Annie.

She tried to pick the mouse up. But Peanut hid behind the mango on the letter M.

“Maybe she's nervous about being on the moon,” said Annie.

“She's not the only one," said Jack. He let out a deep breath, then he pushed his glasses into place.

“So what's a moon base?" asked Annie.

Jack looked at the book. He read aloud:

​			When scientists visit the moon for short periods, they eat and sleep in the moon base.

“A space motel!” said Annie.

"I guess," said Jack. He read more:

​		The small base has a landing chamber and a room for storing spacesuits. Air and temperature     	                       		controls make breathing possible.

“So that's why we can breathe," Jack said.

“Let's explore,” said Annie. “We have to find the fourth thing for Morgan."

“No, first we should study this map," said Jack. He pulled out his notebook.

“you study it," said Annie.

Jack copied the map. Then he drew in the tree house.

​		“map”

“Okay,” he said. He pointed at the X in his drawing. “We're here.”

Jack looked up. Annie was gone.

“Oh, brother” Jack said. As usual, she had left without him. Before they could even make a plan.

Jack put the moon book and pencil into his pack. Carrying his notebook and backpack, he started out the window.

Squeak! Squeak!

Jack looked back at Peanut. The mouse was running back and forth on the M.

“Stay here and be safe," said Jack. “We’ll be back soon.”

Jack swung himself over the window sill. His feet touched the floor of the landing chamber.

“Annie!” he called.

There was no answer

Jack looked at his diagram.

It showed only one way to go. Jack walked along the curved white wall to the stairs.

He climbed the steps to a hallway.

“Jack--hurry!” Annie was at the end of the hallway, standing in the airlock. She peered out a window in a giant door.

Jack hurried toward her. Annie stepped aside so he could look out the window, too.

“Oh, man” said Jack. What he saw took his breath away.

He stared at a rocky gray land. The land was filled with giant craters and tall mountains. The sun was shining. But the sky was ink-black!

“Say hi to the moon,” Annie said softly.



## 3：Open Sesame!

“The fourth M thing must be out there," said Annie.

Beside the door was a button with the word OPEN on it. Annie reached for the button.

“Wait!” Jack grabbed her hand. “There's no air on the moon. Remember?”

“Oh Right, But we have to go out to find the M thing.”

“Let's see what the book says," said Jack.

He pulled the book out of his pack. He flipped through it until he found a page that showed the surface of the moon. He read aloud:

​			It takes fourteen Earth days to equal one day on the moon. No air protects the moon from the 			sun's rays, so daytime heat reaches 260 degrees.

Jack looked at Annie. “I told you our blood would boil if we went out there," he said.

“yuck," she said.

Jack read from the book again:

​			Moon scientists wear spacesuits, which have controls to keep them from getting too hot or too 			cold. They have tanks, which provide air for two hours.

Where do we get spacesuits?” asked Annie. She looked around then trotted back down the hall. “Maybe there...?”

Jack was studying his map. “Let's try the spacesuit storeroom.”

“Don't look at the map,” said Annie. “Look at the real room!”

Jack glanced up. Annie was peering through a doorway off the hall.

"There's a ton of space stuff in here!” she said.

Jack went to look.

Bulky white suits hung from hangers. Air tanks, helmets, gloves, and boots sat in neat rows on shelves.

“Wow, it's like the armor room in a castle,” said Jack.

"Yeah, with huge armor,” said Annie.

“Let's pick out the smallest stuff,” said Jack, “The suits can go over our clothes.”

Annie found the smallest white suit. And Jack found the next smallest. They stepped into them.

Then Annie locked Jack's air tank into place.

“Thanks," he said. And he did the same for her.

“Thanks,” she said.

“Gloves?” said Jack. He and Annie pulled on white gloves.

"Boots?” said Annie. They each pulled on a pair of huge white boots.

“Helmets?” said Jack. He reached for a helmet.

“Wow, they're pretty light," he said. “I thought they'd be like knights' helmets.”

Jack and Annie put the helmets on. They locked each other's into place.

“I can't move my head right or left,” said Annie.

“Me neither,” said Jack. “Let's try walking."

Jack and Annie moved clumsily around the room. Jack felt like a fat snowman.

"Close your visor," said Annie.

They both closed their see-through visors.

Cool air filled Jack's helmet.

“I CAN BREATHE!” Annie yelled. Her voice boomed in Jack's ears.

“Ow! Talk quietly.” Jack said. “We have two-way radios inside our helmets."

“Sorry,” whispered Annie.

Jack put the moon book back in his pack. Then he slung the pack over his shoulder.

“Okay!” he said. “Remember, we only have two hours of air in our tanks. So we need to find the fourth M thing really fast."

“I hope we can find it," said Annie.

“Me too," said Jack. He knew they could not go home until they did.

"Let's go," said Annie. She gave Jack a little push.

Watch it. No goofing off,” he said. “We don't want to fall over in these suits."

“Just go——go!” said Annie. She pushed him out of the room. They walked back to the airlock.

“Ready?” said Annie. "Open sesame!” She pressed the OPEN button. A door slowly slid closed behind them, A door opened in front of them.

And Jack and Annie stepped out onto the moon.

## 4：Moon Rabbits

“Oh, wow!" said Annie. She took a step forward.

But Jack stood frozen. He wanted to get a good look at everything first.

He stared at the ground. He was standing in a layer of gray dust as fine as powder.

Footprints were everywhere. Jack wondered who had made them.

He reached into his pack for the moon book. To his surprise, it was as light as a feather!

He found a picture of footprints on the moon. He read:

​				The moon has no rain or wind to blow the dust around. So footprints will never wear away 				naturally, not even in a billlon years.

“Oh, man,” Jack said.

The moon was the stillest place he had ever, ever been. It was as still as a picture And its stillness would never, ever end.

Jack stared at the ink-black sky. A lovely blue-and-white ball glowed far away.

Earth.

For the first time, it really hit Jack. They were in outer space.

“Look!” Annie cried, laughing.

She bounded past Jack-almost flying through the air. She landed on her feet. Then she jumped again.

“I'm a moon rabbit," she called.

Jack laughed. How does she do that? he wondered. He turned a page and read:

​			A person weighs less on the moon because of the moon's low gravity and lack of air. If you weigh 			60 pounds on Earth, you would only weigh 10 pounds on the moon.

“Don't just stand there reading!” said Annie, grabbing the book from Jack's gloved hand. She tossed it into space. 

It flew far away.

Jack started after it.

He bounded up and down. Boing! Boing!

Boing! Now he felt as light as a feather.

“Look!” he called to Annie. “Im a moonrabbit, too.”

Where Jack's boots hit the ground, moon-dust gracefully sprayed into space.

The book had landed at the edge of a shallow crater.

When Jack reached it, he tried to stop. But his feet slipped.

He fell right over and lay on his side. He tried to stand. But he was off-balance.

He tried again. But the dust was just too deep. And his spacesuit was too clumsy.

“You okay?” asked Annie.

“I can't get up," said Jack.

“You shouldn't have been goofing off," said Annie wisely.

“You goofed off first,” said Jack. “Now help me up, please."

Annie started toward him.

“Don't fall, too," warned Jack.

“I won't.” Annie moved very slowly. She half floated, half walked.

“Give me your hand," she said.

Annie grabbed Jack's hand. She pressed her boot against his and pulled him up.

“Thanks” he said.

"No problem” she said.“ It was easy. You were really light."

“Thank goodness," said Jack, “It's impossible to get up alone."

He picked up the moon book. It was covered with dust. He brushed it off.

“Oh, wow! Look!" said Annie. She stood at the edge of the crater.

“What is it?" said Jack.

“A moon buggy!" said Annie.

The buggy was parked in the crater. It had four huge wheels.

“Let's go for a ride," said Annie.

“We can't," said Jack. "We just have two hours of air in our tanks. Remember?”

“I bet we'll find the M thing faster if we take the moon buggy!” Annie bounded into the crater.

"But we can't drive!" said Jack.

“I bet I can drive this,” said Annie. “It looks easy. Come on!”

She jumped into the driver's seat.

“But you don't have a license!” said Jack. 

“Who cares?” said Annie. “There aren't any roads on the moon, or stoplights, or policemen either.”

She was right, Jack thought.

“Well, go slow," he said. And he climbed in beside her.

Annie pushed a button labeled ON.

The moon buggy lurched backward.

“Yikes!” said Annie.

“Step on the brake!” said Jack.

Annie pressed a pedal on the floor. The buggy stopped with a jerk.

“Whew" she said.

“It must be in reverse," said Jack."Let me study this——”

But before he could study anything, Annie pushed another button.

The buggy tilted back. Its front wheels started to rise into the air.

"Let me out of here!” said Jack.

Annie pushed more buttons.

The buggy's front wheels landed back on the ground. And the buggy leaped forward.

“Slower!" said Jack.

“I can't,” said Annie. “I don't know how!”

Annie steered the buggy over the tracks on the ground. The wide wheels kept it from sinking into the deep dust.

“Careful!” said Jack.

The buggy zoomed out of the crater. 

Gray clouds of dust rose behind them as they took off across the moon.



## 5：Hang on

Annie drove the moon buggy over bumps and hollows. It bucked like a bronco.

“I'm going through there! She pointed to an opening between two mountains.

Jack held on to the dashboard.

The buggy bumped toward the opening and shot through.

On the other side, the ground was even rockier.

“Look for the fo-fourth M thing!” said Annie, bouncing up and down.

Jack groaned. Looking for anything on this wild ride was impossible.

“Sl-slow d-down!” he said.

“How?”

“Try pressing on the b-brake pedal. On the f-floor slowly!”

Annie pressed on the brake.

The buggy slowed down. Jack sighed with relief. The ride was still bumpy. But now, at least, he could take a good look at the moon.

He had never been to such a colorless, barren place. There was no green, no blue, no red.

No water, no trees, no clouds.

Only giant gray rocks and craters and an American flag.  

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “That's from the first astronauts who landed on the moon!”

“And look——a telescope!" said Annie.

She drove near the flag and telescope.Then she put her foot on the brake until the buggy stopped.

She pressed a button that said OFF. Then she and Jack hopped out.

They took slow giant steps to the site of the first moon landing.

Beside the flag was a sign. Annie read it aloud:

​			HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON, JULY 1969 A.D. WE 			CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND.

“That's a good message," said Jack.

He handed the moon book to Annie. Then he took out his notebook and pencil to copy the sign.

“Let's leave our own message,” said Annie.

What should we say?” said Jack.

“The same thing," said Annie. "But say we are the first kids."

Jack turned to a new page in his notebook. In big letters he wrote their message.

“Now we have to sign it," Annie said.

Jack signed his name.

Then he passed the notebook and pencil to Annie. She signed her name and passed the notebook back.
Jack tore out the piece of paper. He put it by the flag.

​							Today the first kids from the planet Earth came to the Moon. We came in peace for all 							children.

​							Jack
​							Annie

No wind would ever blow the message away. No rain would ever fall on it.

It would be there forever, unless someone moved it.

Thinking of “forever” made Jack feel dizzy. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Then he remembered the time. Had two hours passed yet?

“I wish I had a watch,” he said, standing up. “We might be running out of time."

“Oh wow. A moon man!” said Annie.

“What?” Jack turned to look at her.

She was staring through the telescope.

Jack walked over to the telescope. Annie stepped aside so he could look, too.

Jack gasped. In the distance, something was flying above the ground.

It looked like a giant man in a spacesuit.



## 6：High Jump

“Who is that?” said Jack.

“I don't know," said Annie. “But we'll soon find out!" She started waving.

“No!” said Jack. He grabbed her arm. “Let's go back to the base——before he gets here!”

“Why?” said Annie.

“We don't know who he is!” said Jack. “We don't know if he's friendly or mean or what."

“But we can't go back,” said Annie. “We haven't found the fourth M thing yet. We won't be able to go home."

“It doesn't matter We can lock the door at the moon base until he goes away," said Jack. “Then we can get new air tanks!”

Jack hurried to the moon buggy. “Come on!" He jumped into the driver's seat.

Annie gave a little wave to the dot in the sky. Then she climbed into the moon buggy.

The buggy took off.

“Careful!” said Annie.

They bumped over the rocks as Jack turned the buggy around. Then they zoomed toward the pass.

Jack steered around craters and rocks. More than once the buggy nearly tipped over.

“Whoa! Slow down!" said Annie.

They were almost at the mountain pass. Suddenly, a cloud of dust flew up in front of them. The ground trembled.

“Watch it!" cried Annie.

Jack couldn't see a thing.

He stepped on the brake. The buggy jerked to a stop.

The dust settled.

A giant rock had fallen into the narrow pass. It was stuck between two walls of rock. They were trapped!

Jack quickly found a picture of a giant rock in the moon book. He read aloud:

​				Rocks of all sizes crash into the moon from outer space. These rocks are called meteorites.

We're lucky that meteorite didn't land on us,” said Jack.

“Yeah, and I guess it's too big to be the M thing," said Annie. She had climbed out of the moon buggy and was standing by the meteorite.

It was more than twice as tall as she was. 

Jack looked at the black sky. The flying thing was nowhere in sight--yet.

“We'll have to jump over it," Annie said. 

“Jump? I don't think so,” said Jack. “It's too high."

“I'm going to try anyway, said Annie.

“Wait. Let's think first," said Jack.

But Annie was already backing up.

“One, two, three go!” she shouted, and took giant, leaping steps toward the meteorite.

When Annie got close to the rock, she pushed off the ground. Then she flew through space and disappeared behind the meteorite.

“Annie!” Jack called.

There was no answer.

“Oh, brother,” Jack said. He backed up and took off toward the rock. He jumped as high as he could. Then he was flying through space.

Jack hit the ground and fell facedown into the the dust.

Jack tried to stand. But his suit was too bulky. He tried to roll over. But his suit made even that impossible.

“Oh, no,” he groaned. "Not again."

“Are you here?” asked Annie. “Did you make it?”

“Yes!” Jack was relieved to hear her voice. But he couldn't turn his head to see her. He could only hear her over the radio.

“Can you help me up?" he asked.

“Nope,” said Annie.

“Why not?”

“I fell down, too,” she said.

“Oh, brother” Jack sighed. “Now we are really in trouble."

He tried to stand again. And failed.

“Can you see anything?”" he asked.

“Just the sky" said Annie. “Wow, is it weird...”

“I'm worried about our air tanks,” said Jack. "I feel like it's been two hours."

“Ja-ack..." said Annie.

“And what about that moon man?” said Jack. “Where did he go to?"

“Jack!” whispered Annie.

“What?”

“He's here” she said. “The moon man is here."

“What?”

“He's standing above me"



## 7：The Moon Man

Jack's heart nearly stopped.

He could hear Annie talking.

“Hi," she said. "We come in peace.”

There was silence. Then Jack heard Annie say, "Thank you. I have to help my brother up now.”

A moment later, Annie rolled Jack onto his back.

She grabbed his hand and pulled him up.

“Thanks," said Jack, once he was standing.

The moon man was a few feet away. His face was hidden by a metal visor.

He looked like a spaceman, A huge spaceman——with a giant tank on his back. It was as big as a refrigerator.

“That's a jet pack!” said Jack. “I've seen pictures of future astronauts flying with those things. It's like a mini-spaceship. Right?”

The moon man didn't answer.

“I don't think he can hear us," said Annie. He's not hooked up to our radio."

“Oh, right,” said Jack. “Ill write him a message!”

"Good idea," said Annie.

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil.He wrote:

​			We're Jack and Annie. We come in peace from America. Who are you?

Jack handed the notebook and his pencil to the moon man. They looked tiny in his big hands.

The moon man looked down at the message. He looked at the tiny pencil. Then he turned the notebook over.

Jack and Annie watched as the moon man put the pencil to the paper. He was writing something very carefully.

Finally he gave the notebook back to Jack.

Jack and Annie stared at the marks.

​		*

“Stars," said Annie, “He drew stars."

“Maybe it's a space map,” said Jack.

“Space map?” said Annie. “Hey, Jack, map starts with M!”

“Oh, wow,” said Jack. “This must be the fourth M thing!”

“Let's ask him what his map means," said Annie. She turned around.

“We'll never know now," she said.

“Why?” Jack looked up from the map.

“That's why.” Annie pointed. The moonman was flying over the mountains.

"Thanks!” Annie cried.



## 8：One Star to Another

"Who was that guy?” said Jack. "What does his map mean?”

"I don't know,” said Annie. “But let's see if it works."

Jack took a deep breath. “Yeah, we'd better hurry back. I think I'm running out of air. It feels harder to breathe."

“For me, too," said Annie.

“Go slow. Don't breathe too much," said Jack.

He and Annie took long, floating steps toward the moon base. Jack held his breath as if he were underwater.

By the time they got to the white dome, he was ready to burst.

Annie pushed a button beside the huge door. It slid open. They hurried into the air lock. The door closed behind them and the door to the hallway opened.

Jack opened the visor of his helmet. He took a long, deep breath——and let it out. “Ahhhh!”

Let's get out of these suits," said Annie. 

“Good idea.” Jack was dying to free his arms and legs.

As they moved clumsily into the spacesuit storeroom, Jack felt heavy again.

He and Annie unlocked each other's helmets, gloves, and boots, and pulled everything off. Then they stepped out of their bulky suits.

“Whew!" Jack said. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes.

It was great to be free——even if he no longer felt as light as a feather.

“Hurry! Peanut's waiting!” said Annie.

She led the way down the steps to the bright landing chamber.

“Yay," she said softly.

Jack was relieved to see the tree house still there. Soon they'd be heading home. He couldn't wait.

Jack and Annie crawled through the tree house window.

We're back Peanut!" said Annie.

Squeak! Peanut ran to the letter M.

“We missed you!” said Annie She patted the mouse's head. “We met a moon man."

“Sorry, Peanut, but you have to move," said Jack. “We have to put the map on the M."

Annie gently lifted the mouse off the M.

Jack tore the star map out of his notebookHe placed it on the M next to the mammothbone, the mango, and the moonstone.

He sighed, then sat back on his heels. “Hand me the Pennsylvania book,” he said. They needed the Pennsylvania book to ge tback home.

There was silence.

Jack turned and looked at Annie.

“It's not working.Jack” she said. “The book's not here."

“What?” Was the map the wrong thing?

They looked around the tree house.

“It's definitely not here," said Annie.

“Oh, no" Jack's heart sank. He picked up the star map and stared at it.

Squeak, squeak. Peanut jumped out of Annie's arms and scurried back to the letter M.

“I've got an idea,” said Jack. He reached into his pack and took out his pencil.

“What are you doing?" said Annie.

“You know how you draw a constellation?” said Jack. “You connect all the stars. What happens if we try that?”

He drew a line from one star to another. He kept drawing, until all the stars were connected.

“Let me see,” said Annie.

Jack held the paper out so they could both study it.

“It looks like a mouse" said Annie.

“Yeah," said Jack.

​		*

“Is there such a thing as a mouse constellation?” said Annie.

“I don't think so..." said Jack.

Squeak.

Annie and Jack looked at Peanut. She was standing on the M.

“Oh, wow. Jack,” Annie whispered, “I think I know what the fourth thing is——”

Jack grinned. "Me too," he said. “It's a——"

”Mouse!" they said together.

Squeak! Squeak!

“Maybe the spell is——Moonstome, mango, mammoth bone, mouse!” said Annie.

Jack touched each M thing in turn as he whispered，“Moonstone, mango, mammoth bone, mouse."

“Let's say it over and over and see what happens," said Annie.

Together, they chanted:

​				“Moonstone, mango,
​				mammoth bone, mouse.
​				Moonstone, mango.
​				mammoth bone.mouse."

Suddenly, a bright light filled the tree house.

The light got brighter and brighter and brighter.

The brightness was blinding and whirling.

The air spun with brightness.

Then everything was clear.

Peanut the mouse was gone.

And Morgan le Fay stood before Jack and Annie.



## 9：Morgan

“Thank you," Morgan said softly. “You have freed me from the magician's spell."

Jack just stared at her.

“You were Peanut?” Annie said.

Morgan nodded and smiled.

“Really? You were with us all the time?” said Jack. “On all our missions?”

Morgan nodded again.

“Why did we have to go on this mission to find a mouse?” said Jack. “If you were always with us?”

“To break the spell, we had to be on the moon," said Morgan. “You could have broken it the minute we arrived.”

“Oh, that's what Peanut——I mean you were trying to say!” said Annie. “We didn't have to leave the moon base at all."

Morgan nodded, smiling.

”But the moon man came along to help us," said Annie. "He drew a constellation of a mouse! Is he a friend of yours?”

Morgan shrugged. “Let's just say we had a little talk. He stopped by the moon base while you were out.”

The same way you had a talk with the ninja master, right?” said Jack. “And the monkey and the sorcerer?”

Morgan nodded. “I always squeaked to the ones who helped you."

“But how did they understand you a mouse?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled again. “Certain wise ones understand the language of little creatures,” she said.

“I bet it was you who turned the pages of the books!" said Annie. “To show us where to go next!"

Morgan nodded.

“But who turned you into a mouse?" said Annie.

Morgan frowned. “A certain person who likes to play tricks on me," she said. "His name is Merlin.”

“Merlin!” said Jack. “The greatest magician who ever lived."

Morgan sniffed. “He's not that great," she said. "He doesn't even know I have two brave friends who help me.

“Us?” said Annie shyly

Morgan nodded. “And I thank you both with all my heart."

“You're welcome," said Jack and Annie.

Morgan handed Annie the Pennsylvania book. "Are you ready to go home now?” she asked.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie.

Annie pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods. “I wish we could go there," she said.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

But only for a moment.



## 10：Eatrh Life

The midnight woods woke up.

A breeze rustled the leaves.

An owl hooted.

The sounds were soft, but very alive.

Jack opened his eyes. He pushed his glasses into place.

He smiled. Morgan was still with them. He could see her in the moonlight. Her long white hair was shining.

“Morgan, can you and the tree house stay here?" said Annie. “In Frog Creek?”

“No, I must leave again, I'm afraid,” said Morgan. “I've been gone from Camelot for along time."

She handed Jack his pack. She brushed his cheek. Her hand felt soft and cool.

“A bit of moondust still on you," she said, “Thank you, Jack, for your great love of knowledge.”

“You're welcome,” said Jack.

Morgran tugged on one of Annie's braids. “And thank you, Annie, for your belief in the impossible."

“You're welcome," said Annie.

“Go home now," said Morgan.

Jack smiled. Home was Earth——that bright, colorful world where everything was alive and always changing.

“Bye, Morgan,” said Annie. She started out of the tree house.

Jack looked back at Morgan.

“Will you come back soon?” he said.

“Anything can happen,” said Morgan. “The universe is filled with wonders, Isn't it, Jack?”

He smiled and nodded.

“Go now," Morgan said softly.

Jack followed Annie down the rope ladder.

He stepped onto the ground.

The wind started to blow.

The tree started to shake.

A loud roar filled Jack's ears. He squeezed his eyes shut. He covered his ears.

Then everything was silent and still.

Jack opened his eyes. The ladder was gone. He looked through the leaves and branches of the giant oak tree, Where the tree house had been was only moonlight now.

“Bye, Morgan," he whispered sadly.

“Bye, Peanut," said Annie.

Jack and Annie stared at the top of the tree for a long moment.

"Ready?” said Annie.

Jack nodded.

They started for home.

The midnight air felt cool and moist. lt was filled with the soft sounds of earth life.

Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods. They started down their street.

Annie glanced up at the sky. "The moon looks really far away, doesn't it?”

It did, thought Jack It was.“

“I wonder how the moon man can be up there all alone," said Annie.

“What do you mean?" said Jack.

“I mean, who helps him put on his spacesuit?” said Annie.“Who helps him get up when he falls down?”

“And who is he?" added Jack.

“Who do you think he was?" said Annie.

“He must be a scientist or an astronaut from Earth" said Jack.

“No. I think he's an alien,” said Annie.“from another galaxy.”

Jack scoffed. "What makes you say that?”

“I just feel it," said Annie.

“Wrong," said Jack. “There's no proof that aliens exist."

“Maybe not now," said Annie. "But don't forget——we were in the future."

“Oh, brother” said Jack.

They crossed their yard and climbed their back steps. Annie tiptoed inside the house. Jack followed her.

Before he shut the door, he glanced up at the moon.

Was Annie right? he wondered. Could the moon man have come from another galaxy?

Morgan's words came back to him: The universe is filled with wonders. Isn't it, Jack?"

Goodnight, moon man Jack whispered. Then he closed the door.
