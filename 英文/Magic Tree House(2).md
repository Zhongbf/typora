# Dolphins at Daybreak

## 1：Master Librarians

Jack stared out the kitchen window.

The sun was not up yet. But the sky was growing lighter.

Jack had been awake for a long time. He had been thinking about the dream he'd had——the dream about Morgan le Fay.

The tree house is back, Morgan had said. I'm waiting.

Jack wished that dreams were real. He missed Morgan's magic tree house.

“Jack!” His little sister Annie appeared in the doorway.  We have to go to the woods now!” she said.

“Why?” Jack asked.

”I had a dream about Morgan!” exclaimed Annie. “She said the tree house is back and she's waiting for us!”

“That was my dream," said Jack.

“Oh, wow" said Annie. "She told you. too? So it must be important. “

"But dreams aren't real," said Jack.

Some dreams aren't, But this one is," said Annie. “I can just feel it." She opened the back door. “I’ll see you later!”

“Wait-wait. I'm coming!" said Jack.

He raced up the stairs. Having the same dream must mean something, he thought.

He grabbed his  backpack and threw his notebook and pencil into it.

Then he ran downstairs.

“We'll be back soon, Mom!” Jack calledinto the living room.

“Where you going so early?” his dad called.

“Just for a quick walk!" said Jack.

“It rained last night,” called his mom. “Don't get your shoes wet."

“We won't!”

Jack slipped out the door. Annie was waiting for him.

“Let's go!” she said.

The sky was pale gray. The air felt freshly washed.

Jack and Annie ran up their quiet street to the Frog Creek woods.

They headed between the trees. Soon they came to the tallest oak in the woods. There was a wooden house high in the tree top.

“It is back!” whispered Jack.

Someone looked out the window of the tree house——a lovely old woman with long white hair. Morgan le Fay.

“Come up," called the magical librarian.

Jack and Annie climbed up the rope ladder and into the tree house.

In the dawn light, they stared at Morganle Fay She looked beautiful in a red velvet robe.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. He couldn't stop smiling.

“We both had dreams about you!” said Annie.

“I know," said Morgan.

”You do?”

“Yes, I sent them to you,” said Morgan, “because I need your help.”

“What kind of help?” said Jack.

“Merlin the Magician has been up to his tricks again,” said Morgan, “So I haven't had any time to collect books for Camelot's library."

“Can we collect them for you?” asked Annie.

“Yes, but in order to gather books through time you must be Master Librarians,” said Morgan.

“Oh, well,” Annie said sadly.

“But you can become Master Librarians," said Morgan, “if you pass the test.” 

”Really?” said Annie.

“What kind of test?” Jack asked.

“You must show that you know how to do research,” said Morgan, "and show that you can find answers to hard questions.” 

”How?” said Annie.

“By solving four riddles," said Morgan. She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a rolled-up paper.

“The first riddle is written on this ancient scroll," she said. "This book will help you find the answer."

She held out a book. On the cover were the words Ocean Guide.

“This is where you have to go," said Morgan.

“The ocean! Oh, boy!” said Annie. She pointed at the cover. “I wish we——”

“Stop!” Jack grabbed Annie's hand. “How will we know if we've found the right answer to the riddle?" he asked Morgan.

“You will know,” Morgan said mysteriously. “I promise you will know.”

Jack let go of Annie's hand. She pointed again at the cover and finished her wish: “I wish we could go there."

The wind started to blow.

“Are you coming with us, Morgan?” Jack said.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

Only the ancient scroll and the ocean book were left in her place.



## 2：The Reef

A breeze blew through the window. Sea gulls cried. Waves lapped the shore.

Annie picked up the riddle scroll. She unrolled it. Together she and Jack read the riddle:

​			Rough and gray as rock,

​			I'm plain as plain can be.

​			But hidden deep inside.

​			There's great beauty in me.

​			What am I?

“Let's go find the answer” said Annie.

She and Jack looked out the window. The tree house wasn't in a tree. It was on the ground.

“Why is the ground pink?" said Jack.

“I don't know,” said Annie. “But I’m going out there.”

"I'm going to do a little research first," said Jack.

Annie climbed out of the tree house.

Jack picked up the ocean book and flipped through it.

He found a picture of a pink island surrounded by water He read:

​			This is a coral reef. Corals are tiny sea animals. 

​			After they die, their skeletons remain. 

​			Over time the reef builds up from stacks of coral skeletons.

“Oh, man, tiny skeletons,” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			Millions of Coral Skeletons

“Jack! Jack! Come look at this,” cried Annie.

“What is it?”

“I don't know But you’ll love it!” she said.

Jack threw his notebook and the ocean book into his pack. He climbed out the window.

"Is it the answer to the riddle?” he called.

“I don't think so. It doesn't look very plain," said Annie.

She was standing at the edge of the water. Beside her was a strange-looking machine.

Jack hurried over the bumpy coral to get a better look.

The machine was half on the reef and half in the clear blue water. It looked like a huge white bubble with a big window.

“Is it a special kind of boat?” asked Annie.

Jack found a picture of the machine in the ocean book. He read:

​			Scientists who study the ocean are called oceanographers. 

​			Sometimes they travel in small diving vessels called submersibles, or "mini-subs," to study the ocean floor.

“It's a mini-sub" said Jack. He pulled ou this notebook.

“Let's get inside it,” said Annie.

“No!” said Jack. Actually, he did want to see what the sub looked like inside. But he shook his head. “We can't. It's not ours."

“Just a teeny peek," said Annie. “It might help us figure out the riddle.

Jack sighed. “Okay. But we have to be careful. Don't touch anything," he said.

“Don't worry" said Annie.

“And take off your shoes so they won't get wet" said Jack.

He and Annie slipped off their shoes and socks and threw them toward the tree house. 

Then they stepped carefully over the sharp coral.

Annie turned the handle on the hatch of the mini-sub. It opened.

She and Jack climbed inside. The hatch slammed shut.

The mini-sub was tiny. Two seats faced the big window. In front of the seats was a computer built into a control panel.

Annie sat down.

Jack opened the ocean book and read more on the mini-sub page:

​				Minisubs have strong hulls to keep air in and protect those aboard from water pressure. 

​				Computers are used to guide the mini-sub through the ocean.

“Oops," said Annie.

“What's wrong?” Jack looked up.

Annie was waving her hands in front of the computer. Now the screen showed a map.

“What's going on?” said Jack.

“I just pressed a few keys——" said Annie.

“What? I said not to touch anything!" said Jack.

An air blower came on. The mini-sub jerked backward.

”Get out!" said Jack.

He and Annie scrambled for the hatch. Jack grabbed the handle.

But they were too late.

The mini-sub slid off reef.

Then it dove silently down into the deep.



## 3：Mini-Sub

“You've really done it now, Annie!” said Jack.

“Sorry, sorry. But look out the window!” Annie said. “Look!"

“Forget it! We have to figure this out!” Jack stared at the computer, He saw a row of pictures at the top of the screen.

“what did you do?” he asked.

“I just pressed the ON button," said Annie.

The screen lit up. And I pressed the star fish.

“That must be the command to go under the water," said Jack.

“Yeah. Then the map came on,” said Annie.

“Okay, okay. The map shows the reef," said Jack. “Look! There's the mini-sub on the map! It's moving away from the reef."

“It's like a video game," said Annie. “I bet I know what to do."

Annie pressed a key with an arrow pointing right. The mini-sub on the screen moved right. The real mini-sub turned to the right also.

“Great!” said Jack with relief, “You press the arrows to steer the mini-sub. So now we can go back."

“Oh, no, not right away," said Annie. “It's so beautiful down here."

“We have to get back to the reef," said Jack. His eyes were still glued to the computer screen. "What if the owners find it gone?” 

“Look out the window" said Annie. “Just for one teeny second."

Jack sighed. He pushed his glasses into place and looked up. "Oh, man." he said softly. 

Outside the glass was a strange world of bright moving color.

It looked like another planet.

The mini-sub was moving past red, yellow, and blue coral——past little coral mountains valleys, and caves——past fishes of every color and size.

"Can't we stay a little while? The answer to Morgan's riddle must be here," said Annie.

Jack nodded slowly. She might be right, he thought. Besides, when would they ever get to visit a place like this again?



## 4：Fish City



There were fish everywhere: floating over the swaying sea grass, eating on the white sandy bottom, peeping out of coral caves.

Some kinds of coral looked like blue fingers or lacy fans. Others looked like deer antlers or lettuce leaves or mushrooms or trees.

Jack read in the book:

​			Coral reefs are only found in warm, tropical waters. 

​			Nearly 5,000 different species of fish live around coral reefs in the Indian and Pacifie Oceans.

Jack pulled out his pencil and notebook.

He started to write a list.

​				Coral Reef Research
​				warm water
​				Over 5,ooo kinds of fish

“Look!” said Annie.

The sub floated past a huge starfish. Then a pink jellyfish. Then a blue sea horse.

Jack added to his list:

​				Starfish

​				jellyfish

​				Sea horses 

“What is that?" said Annie.

Jack saw a creature that looked like a giant pancake with a long tail.

“A stingray!" said Jack. He put that on his list as well.

“And that?” said Annie.

She pointed at the biggest shell Jack had ever seen. It was as big as a footstool.

“I'll have to check on that one," said Jack. He turned the pages of the ocean book. When he got to the page about clams, he read aloud:

​				The giant clam of the coral reef is three feet wide and weighs up to 200 pounds.

“Wow,” said Annie.

“No kidding," said Jack. He added "giant clam” to his list.

“Dolphins!” cried Annie.

Jack looked up. Two dolphins were peering in the window. They tapped their noses against the glass.

Their eyes were bright. They seemed to be smiling.

Jack laughed. “It's like we're in a fishtank——and they're looking at us," he said.

“Their names are Sukie and Sam,"” said Annie. “Sister and brother.”

“You're nuts," said Jack.

“Here's a kiss for you, Sukie," Annie said. She pressed her lips to the glass as if she were kissing the dolphin's nose.

“Oh, brother;” said Jack.

But the dolphin opened her mouth and tossed her head. She seemed to be laughing.

“Hey, I know the answer to the riddle——dolphins!” said Annie. "They're gray and plain. But they have great beauty inside."

“You forgot the ‘rough as a rock' part," said Jack. “Dolphin skin looks smooth and slippery."

“Oh, right,” said Annie.

The dolphins flipped their tails. They swam off into the light blue water. 

”Wait! Don't go!" called Annie. “Sukie!" 

But the dolphins were gone.

“It's time for us to go, too,” said Jack. He was afraid someone might be looking for the mini-sub.

“But we haven't solved the riddle," said Annie.

Jack studied the bright underwater world.

“I don't see the answer,” he said. “There's nothing plain at all out there."

“Then maybe the answer's in the mini-sub," said Annie.

They looked around the tiny space.

“I'Il check the computer,” said Jack. He studied the row of pictures at the top of the screen.

He pressed the book picture.

The words SHIP'S LOG flashed onto the screen.



## 5：Two Eyes

”What's a ship's log?" said Annie.

“It's a diary of an ocean trip," said Jack. 

He peered at the computer screen and read a log entry:

​				MONDAY JULY 5

Hey, that was just last week," said Jack He read further:

​			COLLECTED ROCK AND SHELL SAMPLES
​			MAPPED OCEAN FLOOR
​			FOUND TINY CRACK IN HULL

“This is like your notebook," said Annie. 

“Yeah, the oceanographer was writing notes on the computer," said Jack.

Jack and Annie read further:

​				TUESDAY,JULY 6
​				CRACK HAS WIDENED
​				MUST RETURN TO REEF SOON

“A crack where?” said Annie.

“I don't know.” said Jack. He read further:

​			WEDNESDAY JULY 7
​			MORE TINY CRACKS
​			CANNOT BE FIXED
​			HEADING BACK TO REEF TODAY

“Uh-oh. This doesn't sound good,"” said Jack. He read further:

​			THURSDAY JULY 8
​			DEFECTIVE SUB
​			RETURN TO REEF
​			LEAVE FOR HELICOPTER TO TRANSPORT
​			TO JUNKYARD

“‘Defective’ means broken, right?” said Annie.

“Yep," said Jack.

So this sub is broken, right?" said Annie.

“Yep,"said Jack. "And it was waiting to be taken away by a helicopter. To a junkyard."

“yikes" said Annie.

“Now we really have to get back," said Jack.

“Let's try pressing the waves picture,” said Annie.

She pressed the waves picture on the computer screen.

The mini-sub began to rise slowly.

“Oh, good,” said Jack.

The sub went past a small coral mountain.It went past schools of fish and waving plants.

“Oh!” gasped Annie.

Jack gasped, too.

Two eyes were staring out from behind agiant sea plant. They looked human——except they were as big as golf balls.

The sub moved past the giant plant. Jack breathed a sigh of relief.

”What——? Whose——?" sputtered Annie.

“Don't ask,"” said Jack. They stared back at the plant.

Just then, a long arm came out from behind it.

Then another arm came out.

Then another——and another——and another——and another——and another——and another!

Jack and Annie stared in horror at a giant octopus.

“It's coming after us," said Annie.

Slowly, the octopus crept through the water, Its eight arms reached for the mini-sub.



## 6：C-R-A-C-K

The octopus hugged the mini-sub. Each of its eight arms had two rows of suckers. The suckers stuck to the window.

The mini-sub stopped.

The octopus stared at Jack and Annie with huge, human-like eyes.

“I don't think it wants to hurt us," whispered Annie. "It's just curious."

“I——I'm going to research it," said Jack.

His hands shook as he flipped through the pages of the ocean book.

He found a picture of an octopus and read aloud:

​				The octopus tends to be a gentle, shy creature.
​				Sometimes, though, curiosity gets the best of it and it comes out of hiding.

“Aw. See, I told you, he's shy," said Annie. She yelled to the octopus, “Hi! I'm Annie! He's Jack!”

“Oh, brother,” moaned Jack. He read further:

​				But the octopus has huge strength.
​				Each of its arms, or tentacles, has many suckers, which act like rubber suction cups. 
​				It is nearly impossible to free an object from their grasp.

“Oh, great,” said Jack. "We'll never get rid of this thing."

Just then, Jack felt a drop hit his arm. Water. He looked up at the ceiling.

“Uh-oh,” said Annie.

A thin crack ran along the ceiling. Smaller cracks branched out from it.

Water dripped from the cracks.

We found the cracks," said Annie.

“The octopus better let go! Before the whole ceiling breaks!" said Jack.

"Let go, please. Please!” Annie shouted at the octopus.

The creature blinked, as if trying to understand her.

“Please! Please! Please!" she shouted.

“Come on, Annie” said Jack. “It doesn't care if you're polite."

The octopus blinked at Jack.

"Get out of here!” Jack yelled at it. "Now! Beat it! Sram! Go!”

The octopus shot a cloud of black liquid into the water and disappeared into the darkcloud. Its long tentacles trailed through the water.

The mini-sub started to rise slowly again.

“You hurt his feelings," Annie said.

“I don't think so..." Something bothered Jack.

He looked back at the ocean book. He read to himself:

​				The octopus squirts black ink to escape its enemies. 
​				One of its main enemies is the shark.

“Oh, no,” said Jack.

“What's wrong?" asked Annie.

Jack looked out the window. The water was growing clear again.

A shadowy figure moved toward the mini-sub.

“What is that?” whispered Annie.

The fish was way bigger than the dolphins. And it had a very weird head.

Jack could feel his heart nearly stop.

“A hammerhead shark,” he breathed. “We're really in trouble now.”



## 7：Remain Calm

The shark swam behind the coral.

“Where did it go?” said Annie, peering out the window.

“It doesn't matter,” said Jack. “We have to get to the top."

“More water's coming in," said Annie.

”Yeah, I know. Come on ... come on ... faster!” Jack ordered the mini-sub.

“Even more water's coming in,” said Annie, “lots more!”

Jack looked up. The water wasn't dripping now——it was spurting.

“A few seconds, a few seconds," said Jack.

Suddenly, the mini-sub burst out of the water. It bobbed on the waves like a cork. The ocean sparkled all around it.

“Safe!" shouted Annie.

Jack felt the water rising around his bare feet.

“Uh-not really ..."he said.

“Oops,” said Annie. “The octopus must have made cracks in the bottom, too."

The water was up to their ankles now.

Jack looked out. He saw the reef in the distance.

“The sub can make it. It doesn't look that far" he said.

“Go, go, go,” said Annie.

She pressed one of the steering keys.

Suddenly, the screen went blank.

“What's happening?” said Jack.

Annie pressed the key again. Then Jack pressed the other pictures. Nothing happened.

“It's dead," said Annie.

“Oh, great," said Jack.

Now the water was up to their knees.

“I guess we'll have to swim," said Jack. He took a deep breath.

“Right,” said Annie. "It's a good thing we had swimming lessons this summer."

“Right,” said Jack. “And it's a bad thing we just saw a shark."

Jack quickly found the picture of the shark in the book.

He read aloud:

​				If you ever see a shark in the water don't splash. Swim calmly away.

Jack closed the book.

“We better do the breast stroke," said Annie. “So we won't splash."

“Yep, and stay close," said Jack. 

“Very close” said Annie. Her eyes were wide. But she seemed very calm.

Jack took a deep breath. He tried to be calm, too. He calmly took off his glasses. He calmly put them and the book into his pack. He calmly put his pack on his back.

Annie opened the hatch. 

“Be calm," Annie said. She slipped out of the mini-sub.

“Help,” Jack said calmly. He held his nose.

Then he calmly lowered himself into the ocean.



## 8：Swin for Your Life

Jack moved his arms slowly. He moved his legs slowly. He gently pushed the water out of his way as he did the breast stroke.

Calm, calm, he told himself.

Annie swam beside him. They headed for the reef.

All was calm.

Then Jack saw something out of the corner of his eye.

A dark fin was zigzagging through the water. It was heading toward them.

Jack wanted to splash. He wanted to yell. But he remembered: calm.

I better not tell Annie, he thought. She’ll stay calmer if she doesn't know.

He began to swim faster——then faster. Annie went faster, too.

They both swam as fast, and as calmly, as they could.

Sometimes Annie went even faster than Jack,which made him swim faster. And faster.

Jack was so scared that he wasn't tired at all. He was swimming for his life and for Annie's life, too.

He didn't look back to see if the shark was still there. He didn't want to know.

He just kept his eye on the tree house in the distance. And he kept swimming.

Jack and Annie swam and swam and swam.

It took forever for the tree house to get just a little closer.

Jack realized the reef was farther away than he had thought.

He kept swimming, but his arms and legs felt heavy.

Annie was struggling, too.

“Float!” she said. “Float!”

Jack and Annie turned onto their backs. They floated the way they had learned ins wimming class.

We'll just rest for a minute, Jack thought. Then we'l keep going.

But the more Jack floated, the more tired he felt. Soon he was too tired even to float.He started to sink.

Then he felt something.
His heart stopped. Something pushed at him in the water.

It was slippery and alive.

Had the hammerhead caught up with them?

Jack shut his eyes and waited for the worst. He waited and waited. Finally, he opened his eyes.

In front of him was a shiny gray head——adolphin's head!

The dolphin pushed Jack with its nose. It made happy clicking sounds.

“Hooray!” cried Annie.

Jack looked over at her.

She was clinging to the fin of another dolphin! Her dolphin was moving through the water.

Jack grabbed the fin of his dolphin.

Then the two dolphins swam smoothly through the water, pulling Jack and Annie toward the reef.



## 9：Ouch


The sun shone on the ocean. It sparkled like a diamond.

Jack felt safe now. His dolphin was taking good care of him.

The dolphins slowed down as they neared the reef.

Jack lowered his feet. He felt the bumpy coral. He let go of the dolphin's fin and stood up in the water.

Annie stood, too.

Then she threw her arms around her dolphin and gave her a big hug.

“Thank you, Sukie!” she cried. And she kissed the dolphin's nose.

Sukie tossed her head and clicked at Annie.

“Kiss Sam now!” Annie said to Jack.

“You're nuts," said Jack.

But Sam nuzzled Jack's head. Then he put his flippers around Jack's neck.

Jack couldn't resist. He threw his arms around the dolphin and gave him a quick kiss.

Sam nodded and made clicking sounds like laughter. Then he turned to Sukie.

The two dolphins chattered to each other for a moment. They nodded at Jack and Annie and swam gracefully away.

“Bye, Sukie! Bye, Sam!” Annie shouted.

“Thanks!” Jack shouted.

The dolphins leapt high into the air. Then they dove back into the water with a SPLASH!

Jack and Annie laughed. “I wish we could swim like that," said Jack.

Jack and Annie watched the dolphins until they disappeared.

"I miss them already," Annie said softly.

“Me too," said Jack.

He sat down in the shallow water.

“I'm really tired," he said.

Annie sat beside him.

“Me too," she said.

The warm water lapped around their shorts and T-shirts.

Jack pulled off his pack. He took out his glasses and put them on. They were blurry with water.

"Guess what," said Annie.

“What?” said Jack.

I saw the shark when we were swimming," Annie said. “But I didn't tell you. l wanted you to stay calm."

Jack stared at her. “I saw it, too. I just swam faster so you would swim faster."

“And I swam faster so you would swim faster," said Annie.

“I guess we swam double-fast then" Jack said. He shook his head with wonder.

“What now?” said Annie.

“We go home,” said Jack.

“But we haven't solved Morgan's riddle yet," said Annie.

Jack sighed.

He pulled his notebook out of his pack. It was soaked.

He pulled out the ocean book. It was soaked, too.

We've failed," he said. "My research is all wet. We'll never be Master Librarians now."

Jack put everything away. “Let's go," he said sadly.

He stood up. Then he started across the pink reef toward the tree house. Annie followed him.

“Ouch!” Annie said.

“What's wrong?” Jack looked back.

“I stepped on something.” Annie bent down to rub her foot. 

“What?" said Jack. “A shell?”

“Yeah, this ...” She picked up a large gray shell. "Boy, is it rough. Rough and gray as arock——”

"And plain as plain can be!” whispered Jack. 

They had found the answer.
The shell looked like a clamshell——only bigger and with more ridges.

“How could this ugly shell be the answer to the riddle?” said Annie. “What about the part that says, ’There's great beauty in me'?" 

“Wait——research,” said Jack. He opened the soaked ocean book.

The pages were stuck together. But he was able to turn a few.

He found a picture of the gray shell. He read:

​			Divers search for oysters in deep water. 
​			But sometimes oysters wash up on reefs or beaches, Inside some oysters you can find a pearl. 
​			The pearl's natural beauty makes it a treasuire.

“It must have a pearl inside it!" said Jack.

Annie peered into the crack between the two halves of the shell.  “I can't see anything,” she said. “How does a pearl get in there, anyway?”

Jack read aloud from the wet page:

​				Sometimes a grain of sand will get between the oyster's shell and its skin.
​				This irritates the oyster. So it makes a pearly material to surround the grain of sand. 
​				In this way, over a few years, a pearl is formed.

“I can't tell if there's a pearl in there or not." said Annie.

“Maybe we should bang it against a rock,” said Jack.

Now that would really irritate the oyster”said Annie.

“Yeah.”

“Maybe we should just leave it alone" said Annie.

She gently put the oyster back in the water.

“But how will we know if oyster is the right answer to the riddle?" said Jack.

“Morgan said well know,” said Annie. “Come on.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place. Then he and Annie picked up their shoes and socks.

They climbed through the window of the tree house.

Morgan's scroll was lying on the floor.

It was open.

“Look!” said Annie.

She and Jack stared at the scroll, The riddle had faded away.

In its place was one shimmering silver world:

​			OYSTER

“Morgan's magic,” whispered Annie.

Jack let out a huge sigh. “We got it right, he said.

“And here's the Pennsylvania book,” said Annie. “Let's go home.”

She opened the book. She pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there!” she said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

The wind blew harder and harder.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：The Trae Pearl

Dawn light slanted into the tree house.

No time at all had passed since they'd left. Day was breaking.

Jack rolled up the ancient scroll. He tucked it into the corner.

“We solved the first riddle,” he said. ”Three more to go."

“I don't see another scroll," said Annie. Maybe tomorrow well get the next riddle.

”That's okay,” said Jack. "I think I need to rest-and dry out."

His T-shirt and shorts were still soaked. His backpack, too. Only his shoes and socks were dry.

“And this needs to dry out, too," said Annie. She put the wet ocean book in a patch of sunlight.

Then Jack and Annie climbed down the ladder.

They walked through the woods, through leafy shadows and golden light.

They left the woods and started down their street.

"You know, we should have found the answer to the riddle right away," said Jack. “The oyster was on the reef all along."

“I know, but we wouldn't have had so much fun,” said Annie.

“Fun?” said Jack. You call being squeezed by an octopus and chased by a shark fun?”

“Don't forget the dolphins,” Annie said simply.

Jack smiled. “Right," he said. The dolphing made up for everything. They were fun.

“I guess they were the true pearl in the oyster," said Annie.

“yep..." said Jack.“I wonder what Sam is doing right now.”

“Sam?” Annie grinned at him. “You're nuts" she said.

They climbed their steps and went into their house.

“We're back!” Annie shouted.

“Did you get your shoes wet?” their mom called.

“Not one bit," called Jack. Then he and Annie slipped up the stairs to change their clothes.





# Ghost Town at Sundown

## 1.	How Wild

Jack and Annie were sitting on the porch of their house. Annie was gazing down the street at the Frog Creek woods. Jack was reading a book.

“I have a feeling we should check the woods again," said Annie.

“Why?” said Jack without looking up.

“A rabbit's hopping by," said Annie.

“So? We've seen rabbits before."

“Not like this one," said Annie.

“What do you mean?” Jack stood up and looked with her.

He saw a rabbit with very long legs hopping down their street. Soon the rabbit left the sidewalk and headed into the woods.

“He's a sign," said Annie.

“A sign of what?” said Jack. 

“That Morgan's back," said Annie. She jumped off the porch. “Come on!”

“But what about dinner?” Jack said. “Dad said it would be ready soon."

“Don't worry,” said Annie. “You know when we leave in the tree house, time stops.”

She ran across their yard.

Jack pulled on his backpack. “Back in ten minutes!” he called through the screen door. Then he followed Annie.

They hurried down their street and into the Frog Creek woods. The sun was setting above the trees.

“There he is!” said Annie.

The rabbit was standing in a ray of sunlight. When he saw them, he took off.

Jack and Annie followed the rabbit until he vanished behind the tallest tree.

“I told you! See?" said Annie, panting. She pointed up at the tree.

Morgan le Fay was waving to them from the magic tree house high in the branches.

Jack and Annie waved back to her. As always, Jack was very happy to see the enchantress librarian again.

“Come on up!” she called Annie and Jack started up the rope ladder. They climbed up to the tree house.

“We followed a strange rabbit here,"” said  Annie. "Is he your friend?"

“Perhaps,” said Morgan. She smiled mysteriously. “I have many odd friends."

“Including us" said Annie.

Morgan laughed. “That's right."

“How are you?" said Jack.

“I'm still having problems with Merlin," said the enchantress, "which leaves me little time to do my real work. But soon you both will become Master Librarians, and that will be a big help to me."

Jack smiled. He was going to be a Master Librarian who traveled through time and space. It was almost too good to believe.

“Are you ready to solve another riddle?” asked Morgan.

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

“Good” said Morgan. “First, you'll need this for research ...

She pulled a book from her robe and handed it to Jack. It was the book that would help them on their journey.

The title of the book was Days of the Wild West. On the cover was a picture of a western town on a prairie.

“Oh wow," said Annie. “The Wild West!”

Jack took a deep breath. Just how wild? he wondered.

Morgan reached into the folds of her robe again and pulled out a scroll. She handed it to Annie.

“Read this when the tree house lands," she said.

“Is it the riddle?” asked Jack.

“Yes," said Morgan. “Then you'll only have two more to solve. Are you ready to go?”

Jack and Annie nodded. Annie pointed to the picture on the cover of the Wild West book.

“I wish we could go there," she said.

The wind started to blow.

"Good-bye!” said Morgan. “Good luck!”

The tree house started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.

Jack opened his eyes.

Morgan le Fay was gone.

A fly buzzed around his head.



## 2：Rattlesnake Flats

The air was hot and dry.

Jack and Annie peeked outside.

The tree house had landed in a lone tree on a prairie. The sun was low in the sky.

Right in front of them was the town from the cover of the book. In real life it looked empty and spooky.

To one side of the town was a patch of ground with several tombstones.

“That's creepy," said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. He took a deep breath. “What’s our reddle say?”

Annie held up the ancient scroll. She unrolled it. Then she and Jack read together.

​						Out of the blue.

​						my lonely voice

​						calls out to you.

​						Who am I? Am I?

Jack pushed his glasses into place and read the riddle again to himself.

“There must be a mistake,” he said, “Am I?’ is written twice."

“Well I don't hear any voices now,” Annie said as she looked out the window.

There were no human sounds at all——only the buzzing of flies and the whistling of the dry wind.

“Let's look at the book," Jack said.

He opened the book. The pages were yellow with age. He found a picture of the town and read the words beneath it out loud:

​			In the 1870s Rattlesnake Flats was a rest stop for the stagecoach that carried passengers from Santa Fe, New 			Mexico, to Fort Worth, Texas. When the creek dried up, everyone left. 
​			By 1880, it was a "ghost town."

“Wow, a ghost town," said Annie, her eyes wide.

“Let's take a quick look around," said Jack. “So we can leave before dark."

“Right,” said Annie. “Let's hurry.” She started down the rope ladder.

Jack put the old book into his pack. Then he followed Annie down the ladder.

They stood by the tree and looked about. Tumbleweeds blew across the dry ground.

Suddenly something jumped past them.

“Yikes!" they both said.

But it was just a rabbit——alone, long-legged rabbit hopping past them.

“Hey, he's just like that rabbit we saw at home," said Jack.

“Yeah, that rabbit must have been a sign of things to come," said Annie.

The rabbit hopped across the prairie and out of sight.

“I'd better take notes," said Jack.

He reached into his backpack and took out his notebook and pencil.

He wrote:

​		rabbits with long legs

“What's that sound?” said Annie.

“What sound?” asked Jack.

“That rattling sound!” said Annie.

Jack looked up. “What?" he said.

“There!” Annie pointed to a rattlesnake. It was about a hundred feet away. It was coiled up and rattling.

Jack took one look at the snake and ran. Annie ran, too. They ran past the graveyard and right into the ghost town.

“I guess that's why this town is called Rattlesnake Flats,” said Annie when they stopped.

Jack looked around. The town was hardly big enough to call a town. There was one unpaved street and a few old buildings.

It was quiet, too quiet.

“Look, a store,”said Annie.

She pointed to a building. The faded sign said GENERAL STORE. “Let's look inside.” Maybe the answer to the riddle is in there.”

Jack and Annie stepped onto the porch. The wooden boards creaked loudly. The door had fallen off its hinges. They peeked inside.

The air was thick with dust. Spider webs hung from the ceiling.

“Maybe we shouldn't go in," said Jack. 

“But what if the answer's here?” said Annie. “Let's just take a quick look."

Jack took a deep breath, "Okay."

He and Annie tiptoed into the store.

“Look" said Annie. She picked up a pair of rusty spurs.

“Careful,” said Jack. He poked at other stuff in the store——an old feed sack, a rusted tin cup, a faded calendar dated 1878.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She held up two cowboy hats. She put one on and handed the other one to Jack. “For you.”

“It's too dusty," said Jack.

“Just blow on it," said Annie.

Jack blew on his hat. A cloud of dust rose up. Jack sneezed.

“Just try it on!” said Annie.

Jack put the hat on. It nearly covered his eyes.

“Boots!” said Annie. She pointed to a row of cowboy boots on a shelf. “There are even some small ones, like our sizes. Here's a pair for you. " She handed the boots to Jack.

“They're not ours," he said.

“I know, but just try them on," said Annie.

Jack turned his boots upside down and shook them as hard as he could.

“What are you doing?” Annie asked, pulling on another pair of boots.

“Checking for scorpions,"Jack said.

“Ja-ack.” Annie laughed. "Try them on!”

Jack sighed. He pulled off his sneakers. He  pushed his feet into the boots. He pushed and pushed. The boots were really stiff. Finally he got his feet inside. Then he tried to walk.

“Owww!” he said. “Forget it." He started to pull off the boots.

“What's that?” Annie said.

Jack froze.

“Piano music," said Annie. “Maybe it's the voice in the riddle! Come on!”

Jack threw his sneakers into his backpack and hobbled after Annie.



## 3：Player Piano

Outside, the sad tune played on.

“It's coming from there," said Annie.

She crept toward a building that had a sign with the word HOTEL on it. Jack limped after her.

Annie slowly pushed open a swinging door. They peeked inside.

The fading daylight lit a piano in the corner of the room. The keys were moving up and down. But no one was there!

“Yikes," whispered Annie. “A ghost playing the piano!”

Suddenly the keys were still. The air got very cold.

“No. No way," said Jack. “There's no such thing as a ghost."

“We saw one in ancient Egypt,” whispered Annie.

“Yeah, but that was ancient Egypt,” said Jack. Even so, his heart raced.

“I'll look it up.” Jack pulled out the Wild West book. He found a picture of a piano. He read aloud:

​			Player pianos were popular in the Old West. 
​			The piano played automatically when someone pumped its floor pedals. 
​			Later, with the help of electricity, the piano played all by itself.

“Whew." Jack closed the book. “I knew there was an answer," he said. “It must be electric, and some how it came on."

“I didn't know they had electricity in the Wild West," said Annie.

“They didn't," said Jack. 

He looked at Annie. “Oh, man, let's get out of here!" he said.

Jack and Annie backed out of the hotel. 

When they got outside, they heard another sound: horse hooves thumping against the hard ground.

A cloud of dust seemed to be moving toward the town. As it got closer, Jack saw three riders. They were herding a small band of horses.

“Hide!" Jack said.

“Where?” said Annie.

Jack looked around wildly. He saw two barrels outside the hotel.

“There!" he said.

Jack and Annie hurried to the empty barrels. Jack climbed inside one and tried to scrunch down. His hat wouldn't fit! He jumped out of the barrel and threw his hat into the hotel.

“Mine, too!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed hers and threw it. Then he scrambled back into the barrel. Just in time. Jack heard the horses thunder into town. He peeked through a crack in the barrel and saw a blur of cowboys and horses go by.

“Whoa!” “Whoa!” “Whoa!" men shouted.

Jack heard the horses come to a halt. They stamped and snorted. All he could see were shadows through the crack.

Dust covered Jack. He had to sneeze. He pinched his nose.

“The creek bed must have dried up!” a cowboy yelled. “This town's a ghost!”

“Yup, it gives me the shivers," said another. “Let's camp over the rise."

Jack really had to sneeze now. He pinched his nose tighter. But he couldn't stop the sneeze. He let out a choked “Ah-choo!”

“What was that?” someone said.

Just then a loud whinny split the air. Jack saw a beautiful horse rear up.

She had no rider or saddle, just a rope around her neck. She was as red as the sunset. She had a wild black mane and a white star above her eyes.

“We can't keep fighting this one, boss!” a cowboy yelled.

“Yup. She wants her colt," another said. We shouldn't have left him behind."

“He was too slow" a growly voice said. “We’ll sell her when we cross the border.”

That's terrible! thought Jack. He knew Annie must be upset, too. He just hoped that she wouldn't jump out of her barrel.

But the cowboys pulled the red horse away. The ground rang from the pounding of hooves as they galloped off.

Jack and Annie stood up. They watched the riders disappear into the dust.

The pounding faded away. All was quiet again, except for the lazy buzzing of flies.

“They were mean to that horse,” Annie said in a low, angry voice.

“I know. But there was nothing we could do," said Jack His boots were killing him. He climbed out of his barrel.

“Man, I have to get these off," he said.

Jack sat down on the porch of the hotel. He grabbed the foot of one boot and pulled.

“Jack" said Annie, “I think there is something we can do."

“What?” Jack looked up.

A small horse was running down the road. He was as red as the wild mother horse. He had the same black mane and white stara bove his eyes.

A rope was around his neck. He looked very lost.



## 4：Hands Up!



“It's the colt!” said Annie. “He's looking for his mother!”

She ran toward the wild-eyed little horse.

“Wait!” called Jack. “Oh, brother.”  He pulled the book out of his pack.

He found a chapter titled “Horses of the Wild West." He started reading.

​			At the end of the 1800s, over a million wild horses, called mustangs, wandered the West. 
​			These tough, fast horses were descendants of runaway Spanish horses.
​			Mustang herders captured them and sold them to ranchers. 
​			Breaking a wild mustang took great skill.

Jack turned the page. There was a pictureof a herd of horses. Two of them even looked like the beautiful mare and her colt.

“Hey Annie," Jack called. “You should see this picture."

Annie didn't answer.

Jack looked up.

Annie was trying to get close to the young mustang, but he kept darting away.

“Watch it! He's wild!" said Jack. 

Annie was speaking softly to the colt.

She slowly reached out and grabbed the end of his rope. Still talking to him, she ledhim to a broad wooden post.

“Stop! Don't do anything!" said Jack.

He flipped the pages of his book. He found a section called “How to Treat a Horse."

​			The basic rules on how to treat a horse are simple: a soft hand, a firm voice, a
​			sunny attitude, praise, and reward.

“I've got the rules!" shouted Jack. “Don't do anything before I write them down!”

Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:

Horse Rules

1.soft hand
2.firm voice
3.Sunny attitude
praise
reward

“Okay, listen” Jack looked up.

But Annie was already sitting on the colt's back!

Jack froze. He held his breath.

The mustang whinnied and pawed the ground. He snorted and tossed his head.

Annie kept patting his neck and talking softly.

Finally the young horse grew still.

Annie smiled at Jack. “I named him Sunset," she said.

Jack let out his breath.

“Let's go,” said Annie. “We have to take him to his mom."

“Are you nuts?” said Jack. “We have to solve our riddle. It'll be dark soon. And those guys were real bad guys, I could tell."

“We don't have any choice," said Annie.

“Oh, brother.” Jack knew she wouldn't change her mind. "Let's see what the book says.” He read more about mustangs:

​				Wild mustangs live together in families.
​				The bond between a mare and her young is very strong. 
​				His sounds of distress or hunger will always bring her to him. 
​				A mustang cannot bear to wander alone.

Jack groaned. He looked at Sunset. The young mustang did have a sad look in his eyes.

“Okay, we'll make a plan," he said. “But first I have to get out of these boots."

Jack grabbed one of his boots and pulled.

“Hurry!” said Annie. 

“I can't even think in these things!” said Jack.

He huffed and puffed and pulled. Then a deep voice stopped him cold: “Hands up——or I‘ll shoot!”

Jack let go of his boot. He raised his hands in the air, So did Annie.

A cowboy rode out of an alley. His face was bony and tanned. He was riding a gray horse and pointing a six-shooter.

I reckon you're the smallest horse thieves I've ever come across," he said.



## 5：Slim

“We're not horse thieves!” said Annie.

“Well then, what are you doing with my horse here?" he said.

“Some bad guys came through town with his mother,” said Annie. “They left himbehind because he was too slow."

“Yup, must be the rustlers that stole my last five mustangs," the cowboy said.

“Who are you?” said Jack.

“I'm a mustang herder," the cowboy said.

“They rode through town. Then Sunset showed up all alone," said Annie. “We're taking him to his mother.”

“Sunset?" the cowboy said.

“Yup,” Annie smiled. “I named him."

The cowboy put away his six-shooter. “Well, you're pretty brave to try and rescue him, Smiley" he said.

“Thanks" said Annie.

Jack cleared his throat. "A mustang needs his family" he said. “The bond between a mare and her young is very strong."

The cowboy looked at Jack. “Whoa, you're pretty smart to know that, Shorty.”

“Shorty?” said Jack.

“Every cowpoke's got to have a nickname," said the cowboy.

“What's yours?” said Annie.

“Slim" said the cowboy. “My name is Slim Cooley. And this is Dusty." He patted his horse.

“That fits," said Annie.

Jack agreed. Slim was slim. And Dusty was dusty.

“So tell me,” Slim said. “How did you two brave, smart younguns end up in Rattlesnake Flats?”

Jack caught his breath. He didn't know how to explain it.

“Um . .. the stagecoach," said Annie. “We begged the driver to let us off. But I think we made a mistake."

Slim looked around. “I’ll say," he said.

“When the next stage comes through. we're leaving." said Annie.

“I see," said Slim. "Well, I'm going to take my colt now and find those rustlers. You didn't hear where they were headed, did you?”

“They said they were going to camp over the rise,” said Jack.

“Hmm, must be over yonder,” said Slim. He looked at a low rise in the distance. The sun was a red ball above it.

“Better get going before dark," he said.

“Can we go with you?”" said Annie.

“No, we have to stay here” Jack said quickly. Now that Slim could help Sunset, Jack wanted to look for the answer to the riddle. Plus, he still wanted to take off his boots.

“Shorty's right to be scared,” Slim said to Annie. "This is no job for young'uns."

“Scared?” said Jack.

“Oh please! I want to go" said Annie.

Slim looked at Jack. “And what do you want, Shorty?”

For starters, he wanted Slim to stop calling him Shorty. And he wanted Slim to think he was brave.

“Sure, I want to go," said Jack.

“What about your stagecoach?” aske dSlim.

“It's not coming until tomorrow,” Annie said quickly.

“Well ..." Slim scratched his chin. “I reckon I could use some brave, smart help. But you have to do everything I say.”

“We will!” said Annie. “Can I ride Sunset?”

“I wouldn't say ‘yes' to many kids, Smiley, but you seem to have a knack with horses" said Slim. “Now, hang on tight to his mane, “I'll just pull him along behind me.” 

Slim slipped the rope off the post. Then he held his hand out to Jack.

“Put your foot in the stirrup, Shorty. And grab my hand,” said Slim.

Jack did as Slim said. Slim pulled him onto the front of his saddle.

Jack held on to the saddle horn.

“Sit tight,” said Slim. “It's not far." 

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty took off with Sunset right behind him.

Jack bounced up and down. His boots hurt. The sunlight blinded him.

“Giddy-up!”said Slim.

“Giddy-up!" said Annie.

The horses galloped across the prairie, dust flying from their hooves.

“Ah-choo!” Jack sneezed as he bounced along into the setting sun.



## 6：Split the Wind

The sky was dark by the time they got to the rise. The wind was cool, almost cold.

”Whoa,” said Slim.

Dusty slowed to a halt.  

“They're camped down there,” Slim said in a low voice. “In that patch of trees."

Jack saw a campfire at the bottom of the slope. He saw the horses gathered in a dark clump. One let out a loud whinny.

“Hear that?” said Slim. “The mare. She senses Sunset is nearby."

The mare whinnied again.

Sounds like she's tied to a tree," said Slim. “I think the rest of the herd are loose.”

"What's our plan?” whispered Jack.

“Smiley, you stay here and guard Sunset,” said Slim.

“Right," said Annie.

“Shorty, you and I ride down near their camp,” said Slim. “You keep Dusty quiet while I cut the mare loose.”

How do you keep a horse quiet? wondered Jack.

“Once the mare's loose, she'll break for Sunset” said Slim. “Then you and Sunset take off, Smiley."

“Got it” said Annie.

“Then we'll split the wind," said Slim.

What's that mean? wondered Jack.

“Till we get to Blue Canyon," said Slim.

Where's that? wondered Jack.

“All set? Any questions?” asked Slim.

“Nope,” said Annie cheerfully.

Yup, about a milliom, thought Jack.

“Okay, pardners," said Slim. “See ya soon, Smiley. Come on, Shorty."

“Have fun,” said Annie.

Fun? thought Jack. Is she nuts? Our lives are at stake.

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty started down the rise. Their way was lit by a nearly full moon and a million stars.

Maybe now I can ask Slim some questioms, thought Jack.

But just then voices came from the rustlers’ camp. They were mean voices followed by mean laughter.

A chill went through Jack.

Dusty halted.

“This is far enough," whispered Slim. He slipped off of Dusty.

“Keep him here,” Slim whispered to Jack, “and keep him quiet."

“Wait——” whispered Jack He needed more information.

But Slim was gone.

Jack gripped the reins and held his breath.

He hoped Dusty wouldn't do anything.

For a moment Dusty was still, But then he snorted and began walking.

Oh, no! thought Jack. He tried to think of the rules on how to treat a horse.

He remembered: a soft hand, a firm voice. 

He patted Dusty softly.

“Whoa!” he said firmly. To his surprise. Dusty froze and was quiet.

Jack remembered another rule: a sunny attitude. He patted Dusty again. “Don't worry,” he whispered. "Everything's going to be fine."

Just then a loud whinny came from the herd of mustangs. They began moving up the moonlit slope.

“Hey! The horses!” a rustler shouted.

A gun went off. Jack ducked.

“Come on, Shorty!” came Slim's voice.

Jack looked up. Slim was riding the mare!

Jack was shocked. He had thought that Slim was coming back to ride Dusty.

Instead, Slim rode right past him! As he got close to Annie, she took off on Sunset.

The mare galloped after Sunset. And the band of mustangs galloped after the mare.

Bang! Bang!

Jack snapped the reins. “Go, Dusty!” hes aid.

Dusty leaped after the mustangs. Jack nearly fell off. He clutched the reins in one hand and the saddle horn in the other.

Bang! Bang!

The rustlers were on their horses now. They were getting closer.

“Hurry!” Jack cried.

Dusty cleared the rise in an awkward leap. Jack started to slip out of the saddle. He let go of the reins and tried to hold on to the saddle horn, but his weight pulled him down. He closed his eyes as he fell to the ground.

Bang! Bang!

Oh, man, thought Jack, this is the end. He opened his eyes. 

Dusty was looking at him. Jack scrambled up and tried to climb back into the saddle. It was hard without Slim's help.

As Jack struggled, he heard shouts from the rustlers. Their horses gave high-pitched neighs.

Jack looked back.

A shimmering white figure was moving across the top of the rise! The rustlers' horses were panicking and backing away.

Jack didn't have time to think about what he was seeing. He knew it might be his only chance to escape. Using all his strength, he pulled himself into the saddle.

“Go, Dusty, go!" he shouted.

Dusty took off at full gallop over the prairie. Jack held on for dear life as they split the wind.



## 7：Ghost Story

Jack bounced in the saddle. He felt the cool night wind against his face.

He couldn't tell where they were going. But he trusted Dusty to follow the others.

Finally Dusty caught up with the herd as they began to slow down.

Jack snapped his reins. Dusty came up beside Slim and Annie.

“Howdy!” said Slim.

“Howdy!” said Jack.

“Howdy!" said Annie. “Are you okay?”

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “Yup," he said. “You?”

“Yup," she said.

“That was some good riding, Shorty!” said Slim.

“Thanks,” said Jack, smiling. He even liked being called “Shorty" now.

“Where we headed, boss?” Jack asked Slim.

“Blue Canyon,” said Slim. “Okay with you?”

“Yup,” said Jack.

“This way!” said Slim. He slapped his horse and they all speeded up again.

Slim steered the herd to the left. Soon he led them through a deep, narrow pass.

Finally they came to a boxy open space surrounded by walls of rock and lit by moonlight.

“We'll corral the mustangs here in Blue Canyon,” Slim said.

He got off his horse. He helped Jack down.

Annie slipped off Sunset.

“Take him to his ma,” Slim told Annie.

Annie led Sunset to the mare. In themoonlight, the two mustangs rubbed against one another and neighed.

As Jack patted Dusty's damp neck, he remembered the last two rules: praise and reward.

“Thanks,” he whispered to Dusty. “You were great. You were super great."

Slim unsaddled Dusty, then handed Jack his saddle bags.

“Take those over to that grassy spot. We'll camp there," he said.

As Jack carried the saddlebags, his boots felt stiff and tight. His legs were sore and wobbly. But he didn't mind.

He threw down the saddlebags and his backpack. Then he flopped himself down. He was very tired. Annie joined him.

“They seem so happy to be free and together again," she said, gazing at the moonlit mustangs.

“Yup," said Jack.

He lay back, using his backpack as a pillow. He looked up at the stars.

“If we just had the answer to the riddle. everything would be perfect" he said.

“Yup," said Annie.

“Hey, Slim” he called. “I have a question for you."

“Shoot," said Slim.

“Do you know the answer to this riddle?”Jack asked. “Out of the blue, my lonely voice calls out to you. Who am I? Am I?”

Slim was silent for a moment, then said. “Sorry, Shorty, don't know that one."

Jack's heart sank. “That's okay," he said. We don't either.”

“I have a question, too," said Annie. “Why does the piano in the hotel play by itself?"

“I do know the answer to that one," said Slim.

“What is it?” said Annie.

“It's Lonesome Luke," said Slim. “He's a ghost of a cowboy who wanders the prairie."

Jack sat straight up.

“I saw him! I saw him!” he said. "I just remembered! He scared the rustlers! If he hadn't come, I never would have gotten away!”

“Oh, yeah?” Slim chuckled. “Well, lucky for us, Lonesome Luke sometimes likes to help folks out."

Slim threw his saddle down next to Jack and Annie and sat against it.

“Years ago, Lonesome Luke had a gal who he was just crazy about," said Slim. “She couldn't take the Wild West, though. So she went back east."

“What happened then?” asked Jack.

“Luke went loco. Every night he'd show up at the hotel and play the piano. He played ‘Red River Valley' over and over.

“Then one night he just vanished into the prairie and was never seen alive again. His bones were found a year later. But folks say his ghost returns to the hotel piano to play ‘Red River Valley.’ It goes like this .. ."

Slim took out a harmonica. He began to play a song. It was the same sad song Jack and Annie had heard in the hotel.

Jack lay back down and listened to the lonesome tune. A coyote howled in the distance. The horses stirred in the dark.

I better take some notes, thought Jack.

But he didn't write a word before he fell asleep. He didn't even take off his boots.



## 8：Who Am I?

A fly buzzed by Jack's ear. He slapped it away. He opened his eyes.

The sun was high above the canyon walls. He had slept a long time.

Slim and Annie were sitting by a fire drinking from tin cups. 

“Coffee? Biscuit?” Annie asked Jack.

“Where did you get them?” said Jack.

“A cowboy always carries biscuits and a canteen of coffee" said Slim.

He walked over and gave Jack a biscuit and a cup of coffee.

“It's hard as a rock" Slim said. “And bitter as muddy river water. But a cowboy takes what he can get."

Jack took a bite and a sip.

The biscuit was very hard and the coffee was very bitter. But that was okay with Jack. Since cowboys didn't mind, he didn't mind either.

“I'll saddle up Dusty," Slim said, “and take you back to town to catch your stage.”

“Then what will you do?” said Annie.

“Head south with my herd,” said Slim. “Sell 'em. Then ride across the plains and round up more mustangs.”

While Slim saddled Dusty, Jack took out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:

​			Cowboy breakfast

​			Sitter coffce
​			hard biscuits

”Hey, Shorty" called Slim. “What are you doing?”

“Taking notes." said Jack.

“What for?”

“He likes writing things down,” said Annie.

“Oh, yeah?” said Slim. “Me too. In fact, I first came out west to write a book. But one thing led to another. The next thing I know, I'm a mustang herder."

“Slim, you should write your book,” said Annie. "And let the mustangs go free.”

“Think so?” said Slim.

They looked at the grazing wild horse.

“I know so,” said Annie.

“Yup,” said Jack. “Your book should be about the Wild West, Slim."

Slim kept staring at his herd. “Maybe you're right,” he said. “I could settle in Laramie and write there. Wouldn't have to chase after rustlers anymore."

Slim turned back to Jack and Annie. "Yup. I think I’ll be a writer. Let's go. Before I change my mind," he said.

“Yay!” said Annie. “I’ll go tell them." She jumped up and ran to the mustangs.

Jack packed his backpack, while Slim packed his saddlebags.

Then Slim and Jack climbed onto Dusty. They rode over to Annie, who was stroking Sunset's neck.

“I told him he's as free as the wind now,” said Annie.

“Sounds good,” said Slim. “Give me your hand, Smiley."

Slim pulled Annie onto Dusty. She sat in front of Jack.

Slim snapped his reins. Dusty started off.

The sun was hot as Dusty climbed out of the canyon. When they reached the top, they peered down at the canyon floor.

The mustangs pranced playfully, their coats shining in the hazy light.

“They'll find their way out soon,” Slim said. “Then cut across the prairie. Yell goodbye to your pal, Smiley."

“Stay with your mother, Sunset!” shouted Annie.“Good-bye!”

Out of the blue, a voice called, “Bye!”

Annie gasped. "Who said that?” she asked. “The ghost?”

“Nope” said Jack. “It's just an echo. It's caused by sound bouncing off the canyon walls.”

Slim cupped his hands around his mouth. “Who am I?” he shouted.

"Am I?" came the distant voice.

“Oh, man,” Jack said softly. "That's the answer ...”

“To Morgan's riddle!” said Annie.

“Echo!" she and Jack said together.

Jack looked at Slim. “You knew the answer last night," he said.

Slim just smiled and snapped his reins. “Let's go, pardners," he said.



## 9：Lonesome Luke

The sun was low in the sky when they reached Rattlesnake Flats.

“Just let us off in front of the hotel," said Annie.

“You sure the stage is coming through here?" said Slim.

”Yup," said Jack and Annie together.

In front of the hotel, Slim got down from Dusty. Then he helped Jack and Annie down.

"I hope you'll come to Laramie and visit me," said Slim. He winked. “I might be needing some help on my book."

"Sure,” said Annie.

lim climbed back on Dusty. He looked down at Jack.

“You know, Shorty," he said, “you might be short, but you're mighty tall in the brains." 

“Thanks,” said Jack.

“And, Smiley,” Slim said. “Your great courage is nothing to smile about."

“Thanks,”said Annie.

“Good luck with your writing, Slim” said Jack.

“I'm grateful to you both for steering me straight,” said Slim. “I promise I'll thank you someday.”

“Really?” said Annie.

“A cowboy never goes back on his word," said Slim. Then he snapped his reins, and Dusty loped down the street.

“Bye, Slim!” yelled Annie.

Slim Cooley turned one last time. He waved his hat. "So long, pardners!" he called.

Then he rode off into the sunset.

Jack let out a deep sigh. "Okay. I'm ready to take my boots off now," he said.

“Me too,” said Annie.

They sat down on the porch of the hotel. They started pulling off their boots.

“There!” Jack got them both off.

He wiggled his toes. He took his sneakers out of his pack and put them on. Annie put hers on, too.

“Man, sneakers never felt so good," said Jack.

Suddenly the sound of a piano drifted through the air.

“Lonesome Luke!” said Annie.

Jack grabbed his pack. He and Annie crept across the porch. They pushed open the swinging door.

The piano was playing “Red River Valley." Sitting on the piano stool was the dim but shimmering shape of a cowboy.

Just then the ghost of Lonesome Luke looked at Jack and Annie. He waved a shimmering hand.

Jack and Annie waved back.

Then the ghost of Lonesome Luke faded away. Cold air wafted past Jack and Annie. They both shivered.

“Oh, man, let's go," breathed Jack.

They leaped and dashed up the dusty road. They ran across the cracked ground and past the graveyard. They ran until they reached the tree with the Magic Tree House in it.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder.

She hurried up and Jack followed. They were out of breath when they got inside the tree house.

Annie grabbed the ancient scroll. She unrolled it.

“Yay!” she said. The scroll had one glowing word on it:

​			ECHO

We got it right!" said Annie.

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

"I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Echo from the Past

Jack and Annie looked outside.

The sun had slipped behind the trees of the Frog Creek woods.

Annie still held the ancient scroll. She put it in the corner, next to the scroll from their ocean trip.

“Just two more to go," she whispered.

“Yup,” said Jack. He unzipped his pack. He pulled out Days of the Wild West. He put it on top of a stack of books.

“Ready?" he said.

Annie was staring at the books. Her mouth dropped open.

“What's wrong?" asked Jack.

Annie just kept staring.

“Have you gone nuts?” said Jack.

Annie pointed at the Wild West book.

“Read the cover," she said.

Jack picked the book up. He read the title aloud: "Days of the Wild West." He looked at Annie. “So?”

“Keep reading,” said Annie.

The author's name was below the title. It was in smaller letters. Jack read: “Slim Cooley."

Jack gasped. His mouth dropped open. He and Annie stared at the words for a long moment.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “We were using Slim's book. The book he wrote after he left us!”

Jack and Annie shook their heads with wonder.

Jack opened Slim's book. He looked at the title page. At the bottom of the page, he read: Texas Press, Dallas, 1895.

Jack turned the page. He read the dedication:

​				WITH THANKS TO SMILEY AND SHORTY
​				TWO STRANGERS WHO CHANGED MY LIFE

Jack looked at Annie. “Slim dedicated his book to us," he said.

“Yup," said Annie. She smiled.

Jack placed Slim's book back on the stack of books.

Then he and Annie left the tree house and climbed down the ladder.

As they started through the woods, the trees were alive with bird sounds. The air felt sofit and moist.

“Frog Creek seems so peaceful,” said Jack. “No rattlers, no rustlers, no ghosts."

“Yeah, but no Slim Cooley either," said Annie sadly.

“I know,” said Jack. “But when we read his book, it's like he's still talking to us."

“Oh, right," said Annie. “You mean it's like an echo from the past?”

“Yeah,” said Jack softly. “Wow." 

Just then, out of the blue, a voice called. “Jack! Annie!”

“It's Dad!” said Annie.

“Coming!" she and Jack shouted.

Then they ran all the way home, through the long shadows of the setting sun.





# Lions at Lunchtime

## 1：Before Lunch

Jack and Annie were walking home from the grocery store. Jack's pack was heavy. It held a big jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread.

 “Are you going to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” said Annie. "Or a peanut butter and honey sandwich?” 

Jack started to answer, but stopped. 

“Oh, man," he whispered. 

“What is it?” said Annie.

“Look at that!" said Jack.

He pointed to the edge of the Frog Creek woods. In the shadows stood a small, delicate animal It looked like a tiny deer.

“It's a sign,” whispered Annie. “Remember when we saw the rabbit? He was a sign of the Wild West."

The  deerlike creature leaped into the woods.

Jack and Annie didn't stop to think. They followed as fast as they could. Jack's heavy pack thumped against his back as he ran.

Finally, they stopped and looked around.

“Where did she go?” he said.

I don't see her," said Annie.

“Oh, wow,” said Annie. She pointed up.

There was the magic tree house. It was shining in the noon sun, at the top of the tallest tree in the woods. Its rope ladder swayed in the shadows below.

“Where's Morgan?” said Annie. 

Morgan le Fay wasn't waving at them from the window. She wasn't even at the window.

“I don't know. Let's go up,” said Jack.

They climbed the ladder and went into the tree house.

Sunlight streamed through the window. It lit a stack of books and two scrolls in the corner. The ancient scrolls held the answers to riddles Jack and Annie had solved earlier.

Jack took off his heavy pack.

“Did Morgan leave us a third riddle?” said Annie.

“Looking for someone?” said a soft voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around.

“Morgan!” said Annie.

Morgan le Fay had appeared out of nowhere. She looked ancient and lovely in the bright light.

“Do you still want to become Master Librarians?” she asked Jack and Annie. "So you can help me in my work?” 

“Yes!” they said together. 

“Wonderful” Morgan said. Then she reached into her robe and pulled out a scroll. 

“You've solved two riddles so far” she said. “Here is your third.” She handed the scroll to Annie. “And for your research——“

She pulled a book out from her robe and handed it to Jack. The book's cover said THE PLAINS OF AFRICA.

“Africa?" said Jack. "Oh, man, I've always wanted to go there."

He opened the book He and Annie stared at a picture.

It showed hordes of zebras, tall giraffes, big animals with horns, and tiny, deerlike creatures.

“Hey, that's the animal that led us here!” said Annie.

“A Thomson's gazelle, I believe," Morgan said.

“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

You'll find out," said Morgan.

“Um...maybe we need to plan this trip,” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “No. Go ahead. Make your wish now.”

Annie pointed at the picture. “I wish we could go there," she said.

“Be careful,” said Morgan. “Just keep an eye out."

“For what?" said Jack.
“The lions, of course," she said.

“Wait!” said Jack.

Too late.

The wind had started to blow.

The tree house had started to spin.

Jack squeezed his eyes shut.

The tree house spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 2：Jump, Beasts! dump!

Bright light flooded the tree house again. A rustling sound came from outside the window.

Annie peeked out and laughed. “Hey, there," she said.

Jack looked out, too. A giraffe was eating leaves off the tree. It had a sweet, goofy face.

Jack peered at the world beyond the giraffe. He couldn't believe his eyes.

He saw a huge grassy plain, a wide river, and tons of birds and animals——more than he had ever imagined in one place.

Giraffes and zebras were on the side of the river where Jack and Annie were. Thomson's gazelles and the big horned animals were onthe other side.

“Where are the lions?” said Jack.

“I don't know" said Annie. "Do you think it's always this crowded?”

“Let's find out" said Jack.

He picked up the book on Africa and looked at the picture of the animals. He read aloud:

​			Every year, in late spring, thousands of zebras and gazelles and millions of wildebeests (WILL-duh-beests) 				migrate from the dry plains of Tanzania to Kenya.

What's ‘migrate' mean?” said Annie.

Jack pushed his glasses into place. “It means they go some place else for part of the year——like birds going south for the winter.

”Oh, right,"said Annie.

Jack turned the page to read more.

​			Before they are safe in Kenya, the animals must first cross the Mara River.
​			Zebras go first, then the wildebeests. The tiny gazelles swim last.

“Ohh," said Annie in a sad voice.

“What's wrong?" said Jack.

“Poor beasts."She looked out the window. They seem afraid."

On the far side of the river, the horned animals were standing at the edge of the steep bank of the river. They stared down nervously at the rushing water.

“Jump, beasts! Jump!” Annie shouted.

“Don't be silly. They can't hear you," said Jack.

He studied the broad plain. “I wonder where the lions are," he said.

“I don't know. But I have to go,” said Annie.

“Go where?” said Jack.

“To the river to help them," she said.

“Help who?" said Jack.

“Those wild beasts on the other side!" said Annie. “I have to help them migrate."

“Are you nuts?" said Jack.

Annie handed Jack the scroll and started out of the tree house.

"Wait a second!” said Jack. “We haven't even read Morgan's riddle yet!”

Annie stopped on the ladder.

“Read it now," she said.

Jack unrolled the ancient scroll and read aloud:

​				I'm the color of gold
​				and as sweet as can be.
​				But beware of the danger 
​				that's all around me.
​				Whaf am 1?

Annie started down again.

“Annie!”

“We'll look for the answer in a minute," said Annie.

“What are you doing?” Jack called.

But there was no stopping her. Jack watched as she hopped off the ladder. Then she started to walk through the tall grass, between the zebras and giraffes.

"I don't believe her," he said to himself. He quickly put the Africa book into his pack.

He started down the ladder.

When he stepped onto the ground, he looked around carefully.

The giraffes were eating the tree leaves.

The zebras were grazing in the grass.

Tons of birds flapped over head.

This is okay, he thought He just had one little question:

Where are the lions?



## 3：Disaster

“Come on, Jack!” Annie called. She was almost to the river.

“Just a minute!" he shouted. He wanted to study the giraffes and zebras.

He pulled out the Africa book and found a picture of giraffes He read:

​				The giraffe is the tallest animal in the worid. 
​				Its legs alone can be six feet tall, and its hooves can be as big as dinner plates. 
​				The giraffe has a very powerful kick, which makes it dangerous to attack. 
​				For this reason, lions tend to avoid giraffes.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​			Notes on Africa 
​			lions avoid Ginaffes

He turned the page and read more:

​				Zebras live in family groups. As no two zebras have exactly the same pattern of stripes, every baby zebra must 				learn its own mother's pattern.

Jack studied the zebras, trying to see their different patterns. But in the hazy after noonlight, all the stripes made him dizzy.

He blinked to clear his head, then read more:

​				Zebras are the first to cross the river because they eat the coarsest grass.
​				After they've thinned down the top layer, the wildebeests arrive and eat the next layer. 
​				They prepare the grass for the gazelles, who come last.

Wow thought Jack. Each animal depends on the one that goes before.

He wrote:

​					animals all connected

Jack heard Annie shouting from the riverbank. “Jump, beasts! Jump! You can do it! Don't be afraid! Come on!”

He looked up. Annie herself was jumping as she called to the wildebeests.

Jack sighed. I’d better stop her before there's trouble, he thought.

He put away the Africa book and his notebook. Then he jogged toward the river. His pack was heavy and lumpy, bumping againsthis back. He'd forgotten to take out the jar of peanut butter and the loaf of bread.

Jack decided to leave them at the tree house. He turned to go back. 

But just then, Annie's shouting stopped.

Jack looked at the river.

She had vanished.

“Annie?" he called.

No answer.

Where was she?

“Annie!” Jack shouted.

She had completely disappeared.

“Oh, man,” said Jack.

Their trip had barely begun, and already disaster had struck!

He forgot about the stuff in his pack. He just ran as fast as he could.

He wove his way between the grazing zebras and giraffes as he raced to the river.

“Help!” called Annie.





## 4：Mud Bath

Jack looked over the edge of the riverbank.

Annie had fallen into a pool of mud near the water. The thick black mud was up to her chest.

“I slipped,” she said. “It feels like quicksand,“

Jack threw down his pack and got on his knees.

“Be careful," said Annie. “Don't slip, too."

Jack pointed to a tangle of old tree roots sticking out of the bank. “Grab those!” he said.

Annie reached for the roots. “Too far," she said, breathing hard. “I'm sinking.”

She was sinking. The mud was up to her neck.

“Hold on!” Jack looked around wildly. He saw a fallen tree branch near the bank.

He raced to it, picked it up, and carried it back to Annie. Only her head and arms stuck out of the mud now.

Jack held out the branch. Annie grabbed it.

“Hold tight," said Jack. “I'll drag you over to the roots!”

He started pulling on the branch.

“I'm still sinking!” Annie wailed. The mud was up to her chin.

“Come ont!” said Jack. “You can do it! I know you can! Try! Try!"

Just then, Jack heard a splash! He looked up.

On the other side of the wide river, a wildebeest had jumped into the water. Another jumped...then another. They were headed right toward Jack and Annie.

“Hold on tight!” said Jack. He pulled on the stick again.

Annie moved a tiny bit.

“Hey, Jack, on the moon it felt like I weighed ten pounds," said Annie. "And in this mud it feels like I weigh a ton."

“Concentrate, Annie,” said Jack, trying not to slip down the bank.

“I am.”

The lead wildebeests were halfway across, swimming toward them. Many more wildebeests were jumping into the water.

“It's now or never!" said Jack. He took a deep breath. He pulled really hard.

Just then, a shadow passed over them.

Jack looked up.

“Uh-oh,” he said.

A huge vulture circled over head.

“It thinks you're near the end,” said Jack. 

"Oh, get out of here!” Annie shouted at the vulture. "I'm fine!”

In a burst of fury, she let go of the branch. She lunged for the roots. She grabbed them! 

“Yes!" cried Jack, “Pull! Pull!”

Slowly, Annie pulled herself out. She was covered with the black mud from head to toe.

Jack helped her onto the bank, getting mud all over himself.

“See!” Annie shook her fist at the vulture. “I'm fine! Now beat it!”

But the giant, ugly bird still circled. 

“Come on. Let's get away from him," said Jack. He pushed his glasses into place.

“Rats," he said. Now his glasses were muddy.

He tried to clean his hands in the grass.

“Oh, no!” shouted Annie.

Jack turned to her.

"The wildebeests will get stuck in the mudhole!” she cried. She waved her arms at the wildebeests struggling to swim across the river.

"Not here," she shouted. “Not here!” But the frantic swimmers kept coming.



## 5：Ha-Ha

“Oh no! No! Not” shouted Annie. 

She raced down the bank, until she reached a sandy, clear spot.

“Here! Here!" she called.

The wildebeests followed her with their wild eyes.

Jack watched in disbelief as the swimmers changed their course. Slowly, all the wildebeests swam to where Annie stood. She waved them in like a traffic policeman.

Jack grabbed his backpack.

“Annie,” he cried, "let's go before we get trampled!”

“Keep it up," she shouted to the wildebeests as she took off after Jack.

They ran farther up the river, away from the incoming wildebeests. Finally they stopped to catch their breath. They looked back.

Everything seemed fine. The wildebeests were scrambling safely over the riverbank. Soon they would graze on the grass prepared by the zebras.

“Good work,” Jack said to Annie.

“Thanks,” she said. "Okay, now for our riddle...”

“No, first we've got to get clean,"” said Jack. “You look like you're in a mud suit.”

High-pitched laughter rang through the air. It sounded mocking and mean.

Jack and Annie turned around. They saw two spotted brown animals standing in the tall grass.

The creatures had bodies like dogs, but with sloping backs. They laughed again.

“Ha-ha," said Annie. "You don't look so great yourself.”

“What are they?” said Jack. He took out the book. He tried not to get mud on it as he looked for a picture. When he found it, he read aloud:

​					Om the African plains, the hyena (hi-EE-nuh) is the ruling predator after the lion.
​					It makes a sound similar to a high-pitched human laugh.

“What's ‘predator?’ mean?” said Annie.

“It means it catches things and eats them," said Jack.

“Oh,” said Annie. “Yuck."

The two hyenas laughed again. And they moved closer to Jack and Annie.

Quietly, Jack read more:

​				The hyena has a reputation for being a thief and a coward.

“Let's see if they're cowards,” whispered Annie. “Let's try to scare them."

The hyenas laughed and moved a little closer.

“How?” Jack asked.

“Act like a monster!" said Annie. “Now!” 

Jack and Annie made terrible monster faces. They put out their hands and rushed at the hyenas.

“ARGGGGHH!” they shouted.

The hyenas yelped and scurried off.

“Scaredy-cats!” Annie shouted after them.

“Come on,” said Jack.

Annie and Jack took off in the other direction. They ran around a bend in the river.

Jack heard the hyena laughter again. It sounded far away.

“Good," he said, "they're gone."

“Hey maybe we can wash over there,” said Annie.

She pointed to the edge of the forest. There was a small pond surrounded by tallgrass. Zebras were drinking the water.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “If it's safe enough for them to drink..”

The zebras ignored them as they walked toward the pond.

When they reached the edge of the water, Jack set his heavy pack down in the dry grass. He glanced around. No lions were in sight. But then he heard something.

On the far side of the pond, something very big was coming out of the trees.



## 6：Spick-and-Span

”Be still," said Jack.

Jack and Annie stood frozen as an elephant stepped out of the shadows. It waded into the pond and dipped its trunk into the water.

“Oh, wow," aid Annie.

Jack breathed a sigh of relief. An elephant wasn't going to chase them and eat them. Still, the elephant was huge.

“Let's sneak away," said Jack.

“But I want to watch,” said Annie.

“Fine,” said Jack. He was tired of Annie getting sidetracked. “I'm going to solve the riddle by myself. I’ll meet you back at the tree house."

He turned to go. A spray of water rained down on him. It came from behind. He shouted with surprise and looked back.

The elephant's trunk was pointed straight at Annie.

“Cool!” she cried. “He's giving me a shower!”

The elephant sprayed her again...then again. The mud slowly rolled off her face, her braids, her T-shirt, her shorts, her legs, and her sneakers.

“I guess the elephant doesn't like dirty kids!" said Annie, laughing. Her eyes were squeezed shut.

Finally, she was clean and soaking wet.

“Now it's your turn" she said to Jack.

Jack stepped forward and shut his eyes tight. A blast of water hit him. It did feel like a shower——a strong shower.

When Jack was clean, the elephant let out a grunt. Then he started to splash himself with water.

“Thanks!” said Annie.

”Yeah, thanks!” said Jack.

“I'm spick-and-span now, said Annie. When the sun dries me off, I'll be like new."

“Good,” said Jack. “Now we can get serious."

He picked up his heavy pack. “We have to figure out the answer to the riddle. So we can leave this place...before we run into real trouble."

He looked around nervously. Where are the lions? he wondered.

A small bird flitted near his head.

“Hi" Annie said to the bird.

Jack turned back to her. “According to the riddle, we're looking for something gold and sweet."

“What do you want?” Annie asked the bird.

The bird twittered and flew around Jack and Annie. Its feathers were dull gray. But it had a bright, happy manner.

“Annie, listen to me, not the bird," said Jack.

The bird kept fluttering around them.

"She's trying to tell us something," said Annie.

Jack let out a long sigh. “You are driving me crazy today," he said.

“But I feel like she needs our help," said Annie. “Maybe her babies fell out of the nest."

"Annie, you can't save every animal in Africa" said Jack.

This bird is important,” said Annie “Trust me.”

The bird darted toward the trees. It landed on a branch and cocked its head at them.

“She says follow,” said Annie.

The bird headed into the forest. Annie started after it.

“Don' go in there!” said Jack. “You might run into——”

There was no need to finish. The bird and Annie had disappeared into the trees.

“——a snake or a lion," Jack said to himself.

“Come on!” Annie called.

Jack moaned. He pulled on his pack and ran. The peanut butter jar thumped agains this back.



## 7：Hi, There

The forest was cooler than the sunny plains.

It was filled with shadows and bird calls.

“Where are you?” Jack shouted.

”Here!" said Annie.

He found her in a thick glade.

Bright rays streamed between the trees.Green leaves and vines swayed in the dappled light.

The little gray bird sat in a tree, twittering at them.

“Yuck, what's that?” said Annie. She pointed at a round brown thing hanging from a low branch. Bees buzzed around it.

“If that's her nest, its a pretty weird nest" said Annie.

“That's not a nest," said Jack. "It's a beehive. Don't you see the bees?”

”yikes,” said Annie. She stepped back from the tree.

But the little bird darted at the beehive and pecked at it.

“What's she doing?” said Annie.

The bird kept pecking at the hive.

“I don't know. Maybe she's as nuts as you" said Jack.

“Look her up in the book,” said Annie. ”See if it says she's nuts."

“Are you kidding?” said Jack. “That nutty bird isn't going to be in this book."

“Just look."

Jack opened his Africa book. He kept turning the pages. Just as he thought——there was no gray bird in the book.

"Forget it," he said.

“Keep looking" said Annie.

Jack turned one more page. And there it was: a little gray bird, a beehive, and a tall painted warrior with a spear.

“I don't believe this," said Jack.

Then he read aloud:

​				This bird is called a honey guide.
​				It's both a friend and a helper to the Masai (muh-s) people, an African tribe known for their fierce fighting skills 				and bravery.

“Hi, honey guide,” Annie called to the bird. “I Knew you were important." 

Jack kept reading:

​				The honey guide leads a Masai tribesperson to a beehive. 
​				The bird waits for him or her to scatter the bees and take the honey, Then the bird feasts on the honeycomb.

“That's cool,” said Jack. “They work together, like the zebras and wildebeests and gazelles.”

“Yeah,” said Annie. “And she wants us to be her helpers. We have to scatter the bees and leave her the honeycomb."

“How do we do that?" said Jack. He looked back at the book. It didn't say how.

“Well maybe we could wave those weeds at them,” said Annie. She pointed to some bright green plants that looked like giant fans.

Jack put his book and backpack down. He and Annie pulled up the weeds. They waved them near the tree, and the bees scattered. 

Next, Jack grabbed the tree branch and jiggled it. The hive fell to the ground and broke open.

Annie stooped and stuck her finger into the golden honeyeomb.

“Yummy,” she said when she tasted the honey. “Try it."

Jack stuck his finger in the honeycomb, too. He licked off the golden honey. It was the sweetest honey he had ever tasted.

“Now the honey guide can get to her honeycomb," said Annie.

“Yeah, but she'd better hurry. Before the bees come back," said Jack.

“It's weird," said Annie. "Honey's so sweet and good. But to get it, you have to go past a lot of dangerous bees."

“Oh, man," whispered Jack, “That's it."

“That's what?” asked Annie.

Jack said Morgan's riddle:

​			I'm the color of gold
​			and as sweet as can be.
​			But beware of the danger
​			that's all around me.
​			What am I?

“I get it,” Annie whispered. “Honey..."

“Honey,” said Jack, nodding and smiling. That's it. We've answered Morgan's riddle. Let's go home."

He stood up to leave. He gasped.

Standing in the shadows was a tall man with a spear and a curved sword hanging from his belt. His face was painted in fierce, bright colors.

Jack knew at once what he was.

A Masai warrior.

“Hi, there," Annie said in a small voice.



## 8：Yum

The warrior stared back at Jack and Annie.

“We were helping one of your honey guides" said Annie.

The warrior was as still as a statue.

“We didn't mean to steal anything," Jack said. “In fact, it's all yours. We've had enough."

“Lots of good honey still there,” Annie said, smiling.

The warrior narrowed his eyes.

Is he angry? Jack wondered.

“I'm sorry we were trespassing," said Jack. “We come in peace. In fact, we bring gifts." He picked up his backpack and held it out to the warrior.

The warrior still didn't move.

”This?” Jack held up his book.

Nothing.

“Uh——” Jack reached into his pack. He pulled out the big jar of peanut butter.

"Peanut butter!” He pulled out the loaf of bread. “Bread! Hey. Hey! How about a peanut butter and honey sandwich?”

”yum!” Annie said watching the warrior.

The warrior stared at the food.

“We'll show you," said Jack.

As Jack unwrapped the bread, his hands shook.

Annie opened the jar.

“We don't have anything to spread it with," she said.

“Use your fingers," said Jack.

“Excuse me," Annie said to the warrior. "l have to use my fingers. But they're pretty clean. An elephant just——"

“Just do it, Annie!” said Jack.

“Okay, okay."

She spread the peanut butter onto a slice of bread with her fingers. At the same time, Jack spread the honey from the beehive on another slice.

Jack and Annie put their pieces of bread together.

“Ta-da!” said Annie, handing the sandwich to the warrior.

The warrior took the sandwich, but he didn't eat it. He just looked at it.

“Let's make sandwiches for us, too," Jack said. "So he doesn't have to eat alone."

They quickly made two more sandwiches.

“See, like this," said Annie. She bit into her sandwich. “Mmm...yum."

Jack took a bite too. "Mmm..." he said. It was really good.

Finally, the warrior bit into his sandwich. He chewed slowly.

“This is called a picnic," said Annie.

They ate their sandwiches in silence.

When they finished, Jack screwed the lid back on the peanut butter jar.

“Not bad. huh?" he said.

The warrior smiled. He had a kind, dignified smile.

Jack and Annie smiled back at him.

Then the warrior turned gracefully and vanished into the trees.

*Oh, man," said Jack. Part of him wanted to follow the silent warrior through the shadowy forest.

“Ready?” Annie asked softly.

Jack nodded.

Annie started to go.

“Wait,” said Jack. He put away the peanut butter and bread. “We're going back to the tree house, right? We're not going to do anything silly, like rescue anything or chase birds. Right?”

“Those things aren't silly,” said Annie. “Don't forget that the bird gave us the answer to the riddle."

"Oh. Right," said Jack.

He looked at the little h oney guide. She was on the ground, pecking at the honeycomb.

“Thanks," Jack said to the bird.

“Have a good feast," gaid Annie.

Jack put on his pack. Then he and Annie started out of the forest.

When they passed the pond, they saw the elephant still splashing in the water. He lifted his trunk. He seemed to be waving at them.

“See ya!” Annie shouted, waving back.

They rounded the bend in the river, then started through the tall grass.

As they walked back toward the tree house, they saw the wildebeests in the distance. There were still some crossing the river.

They saw a family of zebras grazing together.

They saw lone giraffes walking from tree to tree, eating the leaves.

And they saw a bunch of lions sleeping in the shade of a tree——the same tree that the tree house was in.

“Whoops,” said Annie.

Jack's heart gave a jump.

“So there they are," he said.



## 9：Tiptoe

Jack and Annie crouch in the tall grass. There was a big lion, three lionesses, and a bunch of cubs.

“I think they’re sleeping,” whispered Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “But for how long?”

He pulled the Africa book from his pack and opened it. He found a picture of lions sleeping under a tree.

He read in a whispery voice:

​			After a pride of lions has eaten, they rest for a few hours, The other——

”What did they have for lunch?” Annie broke in.

“Don't ask," said Jack. He kept reading:

​			Sensing that the lions are not hunting at the moment the other animals graze nearby.

“If they can graze, then we're safe," said Annie. She started to stand.

“Wait!” Jack pulled her down. “Not so fast."

He peered around. The words in the book seemed true: the zebras and giraffes didn't seem to be bothered by the lions at all.

They might be safe. But I'm not sure about us,” said Jack. "We need a plan."

“What if we wait till they leave?” said Annie.

“That could take hours,” said Jack. “Plus they might be hungry again by then.”

“Oh, right," said Annie.

“So here's the plan——we tiptoe," said Jack.

”Tiptoe?”

“Yeah?”

“That's your whole plan?” said Annie.

“Yeah, tiptoe to the rope ladder,” said Jack. "Very quietly."

“Good plan,” Annie teased.

“Just do it," said Jack He stood up slowly.

Annie stood with him.

They began tiptoeing through the grass very slowly.

The lion flicked his tail.

Jack and Annie froze.

When his tail was still again, they moved again.

Suddenly, high-pitched laughter split the air.

Jack and Annie stopped.

The hyenas were back! They were standing off to the side, watching Jack and Annie.

Jack and Annie made silent monster faces and shook their fists. But the hyenas only laughed some more.

The big lion stirred lazily. He opened his golden eyes.

Jack felt the hair rise on the back of hi sneck. But he didn't move an inch.

The lion lifted his head and yawned. His giant teeth gleamed in the sunlight. The lion turned his head as he looked around sleepily.

Jack held his breath as the lion's gaze rested on him. The lion sat straight up. His piercing yellow eyes met Jack's.

Jack's heart raced. His mind raced. He remembered something he'd read——lions avoid giraffes.

Jack looked around. There was a giraffe walking toward the tree that the magic tree house was in.

Suddenly, he had a new plan.

"Get under that giraffe," he whispered.

“Now you're the one who's nuts" Annie whispered back.

But Jack grabbed her hand. He pulled her over to the giraffe and underneath it.

The giraffe's legs were so long, Jack and Annie could stand up under it. Jack's head barely brushed the giraffe's golden belly.

The tall creature froze for a few seconds.

Then she moved slowly toward the tree.

Jack and Annie walked in the same rhythm as the giraffe.

They got closer and closer to the tree house——and closer and closer to the pride of lions.

The big lion had stood up. He watched them moving under the giraffe.

When the rope ladder was just a few feet away, Jack and Annie dashed out from under the giraffe to the rope ladder.

Annie scrambled up first.

Jack followed right behind her.

As they climbed, the lion growled and leaped at the ladder.

The hyenas laughed.

Jack climbed faster than he’d ever climbed. He leaped after Annie into the tree house.

Annie had already unrolled the scroll. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:

​												HONEY
Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book. He opened it and found the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“Iwishwecouldgothere!" he said.

Just then, the giraffe stuck her head through the window.

"Bye, homey!” said Annie, and she kissed the giraffe on the nose.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：After Lunch

Jack opened his eyes. His heart was still racing. Hyena laughter still rang in his ears.

“We made it" said Annie.

“Yes,” said Jack. "But it was very close." 

Jack took another moment to calm down. Then he pulled the Africa book out of his pack and put it with the other books.

Annie put the scroll with the other two scrolls.

The giraffe was the true honey on that trip," she said, "sweet and golden, with danger all around it.”

“Yep," Jack said. “And now we have just one riddle to go."

“Yep," said Annie. “Ready?” 

“Ready."

She started down the ladder. Jack followed. When they hit the ground, they walked through the sunlit woods.

“It's time for lunch," said Jack.

I'm full from our picnic," said Annie.

“Same here," said Jack.

“What do we tell Mom?” said Annie.

“We say we ate our sandwiches coming back from the store,” said Jack.

“What if she asks why?” said Annie.

“Oh.. just say we had a picnic with a Masai warrior in Africa" said Jack.

Annie laughed. "Right" she said, "because we didn't want him to be mad at us for taking his honey."

“Right" said Jack, “the honey from a beehive that a honey guide led us to."

“Right,” said Annie, “and that happened after an elephant gave me a shower. And we scared off two hyenas."

“Right,” said Jack, "and after you fell into a mudhole because you were helping a million wildebeests migrate across a river."

“Right" said Annie. “And all that was before a giraffe saved us from a lion."

“Right" said Jack.

Jack and Annie left the Frog Creek woods and started up their sunny street.

They were silent for a moment.

Then Jack pushed his glasses into place. “We better just say we ate our sandwiches on the way home from the store," he said.

“Right," said Annie.

“And if Mom asks why——" started Jack. 

“We'll just say it's a really long story," said Annie.

“Right," said Jack, “with, like ten chapters."

Annie laughed. “Good plan," she said.

“Very good plan,” said Jack.

They crossed their yard. They went up their steps and through their front door.

”We' re back!” Annie shouted.

“Great!” called their mom. "Ready for lunch?”





# Polar Bears Past Bedtime

## 1：Are you Serious

Whoo. The strange sound came from outside the open window.

Jack opened his eyes in the dark.

The sound came again. Whoo.

Jack sat up and turned on his light. He put on his glasses. Then he grabbed the flashlight from his table and shone it out the window.

A white snowy owl was sitting on a tree branch.

“Whoo,” he owl said again. Its large yellow eyes looked right into Jack's.

What does he want? Jack wondered. Is hea sign, like the rabbit and the gazelle?

A long-legged rabbit and a gazelle had led Jack and Annie to the magic tree house for their last two adventures.

“WWhoo.”

“Wait a second,” Jack said to the owl. “I’ll get Annie."

Jack's sister, Annie, always seemed to know what birds and animals were saying.

Jack jumped out of bed and hurried to Annie's room. She was sound asleep.

Jack shook her and she stirred.

“What?” she said.

“Come to my room” whispered Jack. “I think Morgan's sent another sign."

In a split second, Annie was out of bed.

She hurried with Jack to his room.

Jack led her to the window. The snowy owlwas still there.

“Whoo," said the owl. Then he raised his white wings and took off into the night.

“He wants us to go to the woods," said Annie.

“That's what I thought," said Jack. “Meet you downstairs after we get dressed."

"No, no. He says go now. Right now," said Annie. “We'll have to wear our pajamas."

“I have to put on my sneakers," said Jack. 

“Okay, I’Il put on mine, too. Meet you downstairs" said Annie.

Jack pulled on his sneakers. He threw his notebook into his backpack. Then he grabbed his flashlight and tiptoed downstairs.

Annie was waiting at the front door. They silently slipped outside together.

The night air was warm, Moths danced around the porch light.

“I feel weird.” said Jack. “I'm going back to put on some real clothes.”

“you can't," said Annie. “The owl said right now."

She jumped off the porch and headed across their dark yard.

Jack groaned. How did Annie know exactly what the owl said? he wondered.

Still, he didn't want to be left behind. So he took off after her.

The moon lit their way as they ran down their street. When they entered the Frog Creek woods, Jack turned on his flashlight.

The beam of light showed shadows and swaying branches.

Jack and Annie stepped between the trees. They stayed close together. 

“Whoo."
Jack jumped in fear.

“It's just the white owl" said Annie. “He's somewhere nearby."

“The woods are creepy," said Jack.

“Yeah" gaid Annie. “In the dark, it doesn't even feel like our woods."

Suddenly the owl flapped near them.

“Yikes!" said Annie.

Jack shone his flashlight on the white birdas it rose into the sky. The owl landed on a tree branch——right nert to the magic tree house.

And there was Morgan le Fay the enchantress librarian. Her long white hair gleamed in the beam of Jack's flashlight.

“Hello,” Morgan called softly in a soothing voice. “Climb up."

Jack used his flashlight to find the rope ladder. Then he and Annie climbed up into the tree house.

Morgan was holding three scrolls. Each one held the answer to an ancient riddle that Jack and Annie had already solved.

“You have journeyed to the ocean, the Wild West, and Africa to find the answers to these three riddles," said Morgan. “Ready for another journey?”

“Yes!” said Jack and Annie together.

Morgan pulled a fourth scroll from the folds of her robe. She handed it to Annie.

“After we solve this riddle, will we become Master Librarians?” asked Annie.

“And help you gather books through time and space?” said Jack

“Almost...” said Morgan.

Before Jack could ask what she meant, Morgan pulled out a book and gave it to him. “For your research," she said.

Jack and Annie looked at the book's title: ADVENTURE IN THE ARCTIC.

“Oh, wow the Arctic!" said Annie.

“The Arctic?” said Jack. He turned to Morgan. “Are you serious?”

“Indeed I am,” she said. “And you must hurry.”

“I wish we could go there," said Annie. pointing at the cover.

“Wait——wait a minute——we’ll freeze to death!” said Jack.

“Fear not," said Morgan. “I am sending someone to meet you.”

The wind started to blow.

“Meet us? Who?" said Jack.

“Whoo?" said the snowy owl.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.


## 2：The Howling

The air was crisp and cold.

Jack and Annie shivered. They looked out the window at a dark gray sky.

The tree house was on the ground. There were no trees and no houses——only an endless field of ice and snow. Morgan and the owl were gone.

“R-r-read the riddle,” said Annie, her teeth chattering.

Jack unrolled the scroll. He read:

​					I cover what's real and hide what's true.
​					But sometimes I bring out the courage in you.
​					What am I?

“I'd better write it down,” said Jack shivering.

He pulled out his notebook and copied the riddle. Then he opened the book. He found a picture of a barren white field. He read aloud:

​				The Aretic tundra is a treeless plain.
​				During the dark winter, it is covered with snow and ice.
​				In early spring, snow falls, but the sky begins to get lighter. 
​				During the summer season, the snow and ice melt and the sun shines 24 hours a day.

“It must be early spring now," said Jack. “There's snow, but the sky is a little light." 

He turned the page. There was a picture of a man wearing a hooded coat with fur trim.

“Look at this guy," said Jack. He showed Annie the picture.

“We need his coat," said Annie. 

“Yeah," said Jack. “Listen to this..." 

He read aloud:

​				This seal hunter wears sealskin clothing to protect him from icy winds.
​				Before modern times, native people of the Arctic lived by hunting seals, caribou, polar bears, and whales.

Jack took out his notebook. He wrote:

​				THe ARCTIC
​		Seal hunters wear Sealskin

He was too cold to write any more.

He clutched his pack against his chest and blew on his fingers. He wished he were back home in bed.

“Morgan said someone was coming to meet us," said Annie.

“If they don't come soon, we'll freeze to death,” said Jack. “It's getting darker and colder."

“Shh. Listen," said Annie.

A howling sound came from the distance...then more howling sounds...and more.

“What's that?” said Jack.

They looked out the window. Snow was falling now. It was hard to see.

The howling grew louder. It was mixed with yipping and yelping noises. Jack and Annie saw dark shapes coming through the snow. They seemed to be running toward the tree house.

“Wolves?” said Annie.

“Great. That's all we need, ” said Jack. “We're freezing, and now a pack of wolves is coming for us."

Jack pulled Annie into the corner of the tree house. They huddled close together.

The howling got louder and louder. It sounded as if the wolves were circling the tree house. They whined and yelped.

Jack couldn't stand it any longer. He grabbed the Arctic book.

“Maybe this can help us," he said.

He searched for a picture of wolves.

“Oh——hi!” Annie said.

Jack looked up. He caught his breath.

A man was looking through the tree house window. His face was surrounded by far.

It was the seal hunter from the Arctic book.



## 3：Mush!

“Did you come with the wolves?” asked Annie.

The seal hunter looked puzzled.

“Did Morgan send you to us?” said Jack.

“I had a dream,” the man said. “You were in it. You needed help.”

Annie smiled.

“Morgan sends dreams something,” she said. “We came in Morgan’s tree house. It flies through time.”

Oh, brother, thought Jack. Who will believe that?

The seal hunter smiled as if he was not surprised at all.

“We do need help,” said Jack. “W-w-we're fr-fr-freezing."

The seal hunter nodded. Then he left the window. He returned a moment later with two small parkas like his own. They were made of heavy dark skins with fur-trimmed hoods.

He passed one to Jack and one to Annie.

“Thanks!” said Jack and Annie.

They put the parkas on.

“Hooray!” said Annie. “It's warm!”

“Yeah" said Jack. “They're made of seal-skin.”

“Poor seals," said Annie.

“Don't think about it," said Jack. He pulled his hood up. His head and upper body were very snug now. Only his legs, hands, and feet were still freezing.

“Oh, thanks!" said Annie.

Jack looked up. The seal hunter was giving Annie a pair of fur pants. Then he handed a pair to Jack.

“Thanks,” said Jack. He quickly pulled the pants on over his pajamas.

Next the seal hunter gave each of them a pair of fur boots and mittens.

Jack took off his sneakers and pulled on the boots. He wiggled his frozen fingers into the warm mittens.

“I have a quick question," Jack said to the seal hunter. "Do you know the answer to this riddle?”

He opened his notebook and read:

​					I cover what's real and hide what's true.
​					But sometimesI bring out the courafe in you.
​					What am I?

The seal hunter shook his head.

“Come,” he said to Jack and Annie. Then he disappeared from the window.

“What about those wolves out there?” Jack called.

But the seal hunter didn't answer.

Jack grabbed the Arctic book and looked for a picture of the seal hunter.

When Jack found the picture he smiled. The seal hunter was standing beside a dogsled.

Jack read:

​					In cold weather, the seal hunter travels by dogsled. 
​					Siberian Huskies often howl like wolves.
​					 A lead dog controls the others. 
​					The sled's runners are sometimes made of frozen fish rolled up in sealskin.

“Hey, Annie, they're not wolves,” said Jack. “They're——” He looked up.

Annie was gone.

Jack threw the book and notebook into his pack. But he was so fat in his furry clothes that the backpack wouldn't fit. Jack loosened the shoulder straps and tried to put the backpack on again. It fit.

Jack looked at the small window. That would be a tight fit, too. He went out headfirst and barely squeezed through.

Jack fell onto the snowy ground. The snow was still drifting down. The air was misty white. 

Jack heard barking and howling. He moved carefully toward the noise.

At first, he couldn't see the dogsled. But when he got closer, he counted nine Siberian Huskies. They had thick fur, big heads, and pointy ears.

The lead dog  at him.

Jack stopped.

“He's telling you to climb on!" said Annie.

She was standing on the back of the sled. The seal hunter stood next to her in the snow.

Jack jumped onto the sled next to Annie. 

The seal hunter cracked a long whip. “Mush!” he shouted.

The huskies dashed off in a whirl of snow.

Above them flew the snowy owl.



## 4：Snow House

Jack. “They're_He looked up.
The dogsled skimmed silently over the frozen tundra. The seal hunter ran alongside it. Sometimes he cracked his whip against the ice.

The snowdrifts looked like giant white sculptures as the sun slipped behind the frozen hills. Then a full orange moon rose in the sky.

The moonlight lit a small, rounded igloo in front of them. The dogs slowed, then stopped.

Jack stepped off the sled. Annie went to help unhitch the dogs. Jack took his book out and read about igloos:

​					The word "igloo" means "house" in the language of native Arctic people. 
​					The house is built with blocks of snow. 
​					Dry snow is good wall material because it keeps in the heat, The temperature inside an igloo can be 65 					degrees warmer than the temperature outside.

Jack took out his notebook. He pulled off his mitten just long enough to write:

​					igloo means house

“Come on, Jack!” said Annie.

She and the seal hunter were waiting for him in front of the igloo. The dogs were leashed together outside.

Jack hurried to join them. The hunter pushed aside animal  skins covering the entrance. They stepped inside.

A fat candle burned brightly. Shadows danced on walls of ice and snow.

Jack and Annie sat on a fur-covered platform. They watched as the seal hunter moved about.

First he lit a small stove. Then he slipped outside. He came back with a snowball and chunks of frozen meat.

He put the snowball in a pot over the stove. Then he added the meat.

“What's he making?" asked Annie.

Jack pulled out his book and found a picture of the hunter cooking. He and Annie read the words silently:

​					There was a time when nearly all of the Arctic people's food and clothing and tools came from Arctic 					animals, especially the seal. 
​					Nearly every part of the seal could be eaten. Lamps were fueled with seal fat. 
​					Clothing was made from sealskin. And knives and needles were carved from seal bones.

“He must be boiling seal meat," said Jack. 

The poor seals," said Annie.

The seal hunter looked up.

“They are not poor," he said. “They help us because they know we would die without them.”

“Oh,” said Annie.

“In return,we always thank the animal spirits," said the seal hunter.			

“How do you do that?" said Jack.

“We have many special ceremonies,” said the seal hunter.

He reached under the fur-covered platform and took out two wooden masks.

“Soon there will be a ceremony to honor the spirit of the polar bear," he said. “I carved these masks for the ceremony.”

"Polar bears?" said Annie.

“Yes," said the hunter. “Just as the seal has given us many gifts, so has the polar bear."

“Like what?” said Jack.

“Long ago the polar bear taught us how to live in the ice and snow," said the seal hunter.

“Taught you?” said Jack. "I mean, can you give us some facts?”

The seal hunter smiled.

“Yes," he said. “A polar bear catches a seal when the seal comes up to breathe through a hole in the ice. The oldest seal hunters watched the polar bear and learned. This is how my father taught me to hunt seal, as his father taught him."

“That's a good fact," said Jack.

“The very first of my people learned to make igloos from polar bears,” said the hunter. “Polar bears build snow houses by digging caves in the drifts.”

“Another good fact," said Jack.

“Sometimes the polar bear can even teach people to fly," said the seal hunter.

“That's an amazing fact," said Annie.

Jack smiled. “The rest sounded like true facts," he said. "But I know that's pretend."

The hunter just laughed, then turned back to his cooking.

That's why he wasn't surprised to hear about the tree house, Jack thought. If he believes polar bears can fly, he probably would believe anything.

The seal hunter lifted the chunks of boiled seal out of his pot. He dropped them into a wooden bucket and gave it to Annie.

“Let's feed the dogs," he said.

“Oh, boy!” said Annie. She followed the hunter outside, swinging the bucket.

Jack quickly threw his notebook and the Arctic book into his pack. He started to follow them. Then his gaze fell on the two bear masks.

He picked them up to get a better look.

Each was carved in the shape of a polar bear's face with a blunt nose and roundish ears. There were two holes for eyes and a strap to hold it on your head.

Suddenly howls split the air. The dogs were barking and growling. Annie squealed.

Are the dogs attacking her? Jack wondered.

“Annie!”

Still holding the bear masks, Jack charged out of the igloo.



## 5：You’re It!

The dogs were barking wildly at two small creatures playing in the moonlight.

“Polar bear babies!” cried Annie. One roly-poly cub leaped onto the other. Then they both rolled through the snow.

“Hi, little bears!” Annie called.

The cubs jumped up and shook themselves like wet puppies. Then they scampered toward Annie, who rushed to greet them.

“Hi, hi, hi!” she called.

“Wait——” shouted Jack. “Where's their mother?”

He looked around for the mother bear, but she was nowhere in sight. Maybe they're orphans, he thought.

Jack looked back at Annie. She was wrestling with the little bears in the snow. She was laughing so hard that she couldn't stand.

Jack started laughing, too. He carefully put the bear masks into his pack. Then he ranto join Annie.

She was running with the cubs across the snowy tundra. One of them raced to her, tagged her, then raced away. Annie ran after the bear and tagged him back.

"You're it!” she said.

Jack and the other cub joined in. Soon Jack and Annie and the two cubs were all chasing each other over the moonlit snow.

They ran until the two cubs fell down ahead of them. The cubs lay perfectly still.

Panting, Jack and Annie stared at them. 

“Are they hurt?” Annie wondered out loud.

Jack and Annie ran to the cubs.

Then, just as they leaned down to see if they were all right, the cubs jumped up. They pushed Jack and Annie over and scampered away.

“They were pretending!” said Jack. He laughed.

Jack and Annie charged after the cubs. They ran over the white tundra until they came to the frozen sea.

Jack looked around.

We're pretty far from the igloo. I don't hear the huskies anymore,” he said. “Maybe we should go back."

“In a minute" said Annie. “Look!”

The bear cubs had scooted up a snowbank. They were on their backs, sliding down the bank onto the ice-covered sea.

Jack and Annie laughed.

“It's like sledding!” said Annie. “Let's try it”

“Okay,” said Jack, "but then we have to go back.”

Jack followed Annie up the snowbank. He clutched his pack in his arms.

Annie lay on her back. She whooped as sheslid down the ice.

Jack followed her.

“Wateh out below!” he shouted.

The little bears were sitting at the bottom of the snowbank. One gently whapped Jack in the face with her furry paw. Then she lay down.

“I'm tired, too," said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “Let's rest for just a minute.”

Jack and Annie looked up at the orange moon as they lay beside the cubs. All they could hear was the wind and the soft breathing of the cubs.

“That was fun," said Annie.

“It was," said Jack. “But we'd better head back to the igloo. The seal hunter's probably looking for us. Plus we have to solve the riddle."

Jack rolled onto his side and tried to stand.

Crack.

“Uh-oh," he said. He went back down onto his knees. “I think we're on thin ice."

“What do you mean?” said Annie. She started to stand.

Another crack rang out.

“Uh-oh," she said.

She carefully lay back down.

The polar bear cubs moved closer to Jack and Annie. They made little crying sounds.

Jack wanted to cry, too. But he took a deep breath.

“Let's see what our book says," he said.

He reached into his pack for the Arctic book. He took the masks out first and handed them to Annie.

“I took these from the igloo by mistake," he said.

As he started to reach for his Arctic book, he heard the loudest crack of all.

CRACKI

We're not even moving and the ice is cracking,” said Annie.

Just then, there was a new sound——a low snorting sound. It came from the top of the snowbank, about fifty feet away. Jack looked up.

Staring down at them was a giant polar bear.

“The polar bear mother,” whispered Annie..



## 6：Flying Bears

The cubs whimpered louder.

“They want to go to her, but they're afraid of the ice," whispered Jack.

Annie petted the cubs.

“Don't be afraid,” she told them. “You'll get back to your mother."

The big polar bear growled. She paced back and forth, snifing the air.

Annie kept patting the two cubs and whispering to them.

Jack looked in the book for anything that might help. Finally he found something:

​				Even though a female polar bear can weigh as much as 750 pounds, she can walk on ice too thin to hold a 				person by balancing her weight and sliding her paws over the ice.

“Oh,man, that's incredible” whispered Jack.

He watched the mother polar bear walk down the snowbank.

On large silent feet, she crept about at the edge of the frozen sea.

She tried to step onto the ice. But each time she did, it cracked, and she had to retreat. At last, she found a firm spot.

Then the polar bear stretched out her four legs and lay on the ice. Slowly she moved forward, pushing herself with her claws.

“Is she coming for her babies?" said Jack, "Or is she coming to get us?"

“I don't know," said Annie. “Hey, let's put on the masks.”

“What for?” said Jack.

“Maybe they'll protect us,” said Annie. “Maybe she'll think we're polar bears, too.”

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

But Annie gave him a bear mask. He took off his glasses and slipped it on.

Jack peered through the mask holes. It was hard to see the huge white bear sliding over the frozen sea. He squinted. That helped.

The polar bear looked at her cubs and let out a deep moan.

The two little bears carefully went to their mother. She licked the cubs and touched her nose against each of theirs. Then they crawled onto her back.

“They're safe now," said Jack. “Even if them other breaks through the ice, she can swim with them to the shore."

“Yeah, I just wish she wouldn't leave us behind,” said Annie.

The mother bear slowly turned her body around. Then she pushed off with her hindlegs. With her cubs on her back, she began sliding away.

“Let's try moving like her," Annie said.

“But we could break through and freeze to death” said Jack.

“If we just stay here, we'll freeze, too,” said Annie. “Remember, the seal hunter said his people had learned from the polar bears." Jack took a deep breath.

“Okay," he said. “Let's try it."

He lay on his stomach. He spread out his arms and legs.

Then he copied the bear. He pressed his mittens against the ice and pushed off, sliding his feet.

Amazingly, there was no cracking sound. 

“Grrr," he growled. And he pushed off again.

Jack heard Annie sliding behind him. He kept going. He pushed and slid. He pushed again and slid again.

He made the movements over and over, until something happened: He didn't feel like a boy anymore. He felt like a polar bear.

Then Jack felt something even stranger. He felt like a fling polar bear.

Jack swirled along as if his arms and legs were giant wings——and the moonlit sea ice were a glassy sky.

He remembered what the seal hunter had said: Polar bears can fly.



## 7：Spirit Lights

“Jack, you can get up now," said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. Annie was standing over him. She still had her mask on.

“We're on safe ground,“ she said.

Jack felt as if he'd been dreaming. He looked around. They had reached the tundra at the edge of the frozen sea.

The cubs were romping in the distance. But their mother was sitting nearby, gazing at Jack and Annie.

“She waited to make sure we were safe," said Annie.

Jack stared at the polar bear in awe. The words of the seal hunter came back to him: Always thank the animal spirits.

"We should thank the polar bear spirit now." he said.

“Of course," said Annie.

Jack scrambled to his feet. Still wearing his bear mask, he stood before the polar bear and pressed his hands together.

“We thank you," he said, bowing.

“Yes, we thank you forever,” said Annie also bowing.

“We thank you beyond the moon and the stars,”" said Jack.

"And beyond the deepest sea,” Annie added.

Then she threw out her arms and twirled around. Jack did the same. They both danced around in the snow, honoring the bear. Finally they stopped and bowed one last time.

When they looked up, the polar bear rose up on her hind legs. She was twice as tall as Jack. She lowered her huge head, as if she were bowing back to them. 

At that moment, the sky exploded. The night became a giant swirl of red, green, and purple lights. It looked like a genie coming out of a magic lamp.

The sight took Jack's breath away. He stared in wonder as the dazzling lights lit the tundra.

“Is it the polar bear spirit?” Annie asked in a hushed voice.

As far as Jack could see, the sky and snow shimmered. Even the bear's fur shimmered in the strange light.

No, it's not a spirit," said Jack. “There's got to be a scientific reason. I'll find out."

Shaking, he reached into his backpack and pulled out the Arcti book. He took off his bear mask and put on his glasses. 

By the greenish glow, Jack found a picture of the sky lights. The picture didn't come close to the real thing. He read aloud:

​				One of the most amazing sights in the Arctic is the northern lights. 
​				The swirl of light is caused by electrically charged particles from the sun striking atoms and molecules in 				the earth's atmosphere.

“See, there is a scientifie reason!” saidJack. “It's not the spirits."

Then suddenly all the dancing lights were gone, as if someone had blown out a candle.

The magic had ended.



## 8：Riddle Solved 

Now only the moon shone on the snow.

Jack looked around for the polar bear.

She was gone.

“Where'd she go?” asked Annie.

“I don't know," said Jack. He looked over the tundra. There was no sign of the giant bear or her cubs.

“Maybe she's not interested in scientific reasons," Jack said.

Annie sighed. She took off her bear mask and handed it to Jack. He put both their masks in his pack.

“Now what?” asked Annie.

They looked around. The vast fields of snow ended in darkness. Jack had no idea where they were.

He shrugged. “I guess we just have to walk and hope for the best."

“Wait——listen" said Annie.

From the distance came howling sounds. They grew louder and louder.

”Yay! We don't have to wait long!” said Annie, “The huskies are coming!"

Howling filled the night as the dogsled came into view.

The seal hunter was running beside it.

“We're here! Over here!” called Jack. He ran toward the sled. Annie followed.

“I was afraid you were lost," said the seal hunter.

”We were!” said Annie. “And we got stuck on thin ice, too! But a polar bear helped us."

“Yeah,” said Jack. “And we wore your masks and they made us feel like bears——"

“Yeah, the masks made us brave,” said Annie. She caught her breath.

“Oh, man, wait——“ said Jack. Annie's words sounded familiar.

He took out his notebook and read Morgan's riddle aloud:

​				I cover what's real
​				and hide wha's true
​				Bu sometimes I bring out
​				the courage in you
​				What am I?

“A mask!” Jack and Annie said together.

The seal hunter smiled.

“You knew!” said Annie.

“It was for you to discover,” said the seal hunter. “Not me."

Jack pulled the bear masks out of his backpack.

“Here," he said. “Thanks a lot."

The hunter took the masks and put them inside his parka.

“We can go home now," said Jack.

“Do you mind taking us back to the tree house?” said Annie.

The seal hunter shook his head.

“Climb on," he said.

Jack and Annie climbed onto the dogsled.

“Mush!” said the seal hunter.

“Mush!”said Annie.

“Mush!” said Jack.

Snow began to fall as they took off across the dark ice.



## 9：Oh, No, One More!

By the time the dogsled arrived at the tree house, the snowstorm had become a blizzard.

“Can you wait just a minute?" Jack asked the seal hunter. "So we can check something?”

The hunter nodded. His dogs whined as Jack and Annie climbed through the tree house window.

Jack grabbed the scroll that held the riddle. He unrolled it. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:

​							MASK

“We did it!” said Annie. “The tree house will take us home now."

“Great!” said Jack. “Let's say good-bye tothe seal hunter and give him back his clothes.”

They quickly pulled off their sealskin clothing and their boots.

“Thanks for letting us borrow these!” Jack called through the window.

The seal hunter walked to the tree house and took the clothes from Jack and Annie. They stood shivering in their pajamas and bare feet.

“Th-th-thanks for everything!" said Annie her teeth chattering.

The seal hunter gave them a wave. Then he walked through the swirling snow to his sled.

“Mush!” he shouted.

The dogs took off through the stormy night.

“Let's get out of here!” said Jack. He hugged himself. “Before we freeze to death!”

Annie grabbed the Pennsylvania book that always took them home. She pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there!" she said.

They waited for the tree house to start spinning.

Nothing happened.

Jack shivered.

“I wish we could go there!” Annie said again.

Again nothing happened.

“Wh-wh-what's going on?” said Jack.

He looked around the tree house. The four scrolls with the solved riddle answers were in the corner.

Then he saw it——a fifth scroll.

“Where did th-th-that come from?” he said.

Jack grabbed it and unrolled it. On it were the words:

​					Look af the letters:
​					the first, not the rest.
​					Discover the place
​					that you love the best.

“Oh, no!” said Annie. “Another riddle!”

“Okay, okay. Let's stay c-c-calm,” Jack said, shivering. “Look at the letters: the first, not the rest. Okay, the first letters in this riddle are L-A-T-L-T——”

“That doesn't make any sense,” Annie broke in.

Icy winds battered the tree house. Snow blew inside.

“We have to hurry!” said Annie.

Jack was freezing. He looked around wildly.

“Letters, letters, letters. What letters?” he said.

His gaze rested on the scrolls in the corner.

“M-m-maybe we should look at the letters of the answers," he said. 

“Right," said Annie.

They began unrolling the scrolls.

The scroll from their adventure under the ocean said:

​							OYSTER

The seroll from their trip to the Wild West said:

​							ECHO

The scroll from their journey to Africa said:

​							HONEY

Their scroll from the Arctic said:

​							MASK

“Oyster, echo, honey, mask,” said Jack. Their first letters are O-E-H-M."

“That doesn't make any sense, either, said Annie.

Yeah, but maybe we have to unscramble those letters,” said Jack. “O-E-H-M...They could spell hemo."

“Or meho,” said Annie.

“Or home!" said Jack.

“HOME!” cried Annie. “That's the place we love the best!”

Jack unrolled the fifth scroll again. The riddle was gone. In its place was one shimmering word:

​							HOME

“Yay!” cried Annie. She grabbed the Pennsylvania book. “I wish we could go home! HOME!HOME! HOME!”

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Master Librariars

Warm air washed over Jack. It felt wonderful.

“You have succeeded in your quest," said a soft, soothing voice. “Are you glad to be home?”

Jack opened his eyes. Morgan le Fay stood in the moonlight. 

“Yes," he said.

“We solved all our riddles," said Annie. 

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You have proved that you can find answers to very hard questions.”

She reached into the folds of her robe and took out two thin pieces of wood.

“A magic library card for each of you,"  she said.

She gave one to Annie and one to Jack. 

“Oh, man,” said Jack, feeling the card.

The wooden card was as thin and smooth as an ordinary library card. On its surface shimmered the letters M and L.

”These are your Master Librarian cards,” said Morgan. “You are the newest members of the ancient Society of Master Librarians.”

“What do we do with them?” asked Jack. 

“Take them on your future journeys," said Morgan. “Only a very wise person or another Master Librarian will be able to see the letters. These will be the people who can help you."

“Wow," said Annie. “Can we go on a mission right now?”

“Now you must go home and rest," said Morgan. “I will come back for you soon.”

Jack and Annie put their secret cards in their pockets. Then Jack took out the Arctic book and put it with the other books.

“Good-bye,” he said.

“See you soon," Annie said to Morgan.

Morgan gave them a little wave.

Jack and Annie climbed down the rope ladder.

As soon as they stepped onto the dark ground, they heard a roar. They looked up. They saw a blur of wind and light high in the oak tree.

Then all was silent.

Morgan and her magic tree house were gone.

Jack reached for his magic library card. When he felt its tingly warmth, he knew that amazing adventures lay ahead.

“Let's go," he said.

He turned on his flashlight.

“The woods don't feel scary like they did before,” said Annie as they walked through the trees. “I'm not afraid anymore.”

“Me neither," said Jack.

“Hey, the darkness is like a mask,” said Annie.

“Yeah," said Jack. “It hides the day, but it brings out your courage.

They came out of the woods.

Jack saw their house in the distance. It looked warm and cozy.

The porch light glowed. The moon shone overhead.

“Home," he whispered.

“Home,” said Annie.

She started running. Jack took off after her, running to the place that they both loved the best.



# Vacation Under the Volcano

## 1：A Secret Code

Jack reached into his drawer and took out his secret library card. He held the thin piece of wood and ran his finger over its shimmering letters: M L.

“Master Librarian," he whispered.

Jack couldn't believe that he and his sister Annie, were finally Master Librarians.

He wondered if he should pack the secret card to take on vacation. His family was about to leave for a week in the mountains.

Just then Annie stuck her head into Jack's room.

“Want to check the woods?” she asked.

Every morning, they looked in the Frog Creek woods to see if Morgan le Fay and her magic tree house had returned.

“We can't," said Jack. "We're leaving soon. “But what if Morgan's there?” said Annie. “What if she's waiting for us?"

“Oh, okay," said Jack. “Let's look fast." He grabbed his backpack. He threw in his notebook, his pencil, and his secret library card. Then he followed Annie downstairs.

“We'll be back soon!” Annie called.

“Don't go far!” their dad called. “We're leaving in twenty minutes.”

“Don't worry, we'll be back in ten!” said Annie.

“Right, thought Jack. Five minutes to the woods, and five minutes back. Even if Morgan sent them on an adventure, they would return at exactly the same time that they left. 

Jack and Annie ran out their front door. In the bright morning sunshine, they hurried across their lawn and down the street.

I had a nightmare last night," said Annie. 

“What was it?” said Jack.

“I dreamed fires were burning,” said Annie. "Everything was smoky and dark, and the ground was shaking. Do you think it was a warning?”

“Nah," said Jack. “Nightmares never come true.”

They left the sidewalk and headed into the Frog Creek woods. The woods were quiet and peaceful. They walked between sunlit trees until they came to the tallest oak in the woods.

“Yay!” said Annie.

There it was——the magic tree house. And Morgan le Fay was waving from the window. 

“Hail, Master Librarians," she said.

Jack and Annie bowed playfully.

“At your service," said Annie.

“Then come on up!” said Morgan.

They grabbed the rope ladder and started up. When they climbed inside the tree house.they found Morgan holding a book and a piece of paper.

“I have an important mission for you," she said. “Are you ready?”

“Yes!” they both answered.

Jack's heart pounded. Ever since Morgan had made them Master Librarians, he had been longing for their first mission.

You know I collect books for Camelot's library?" she said.

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Well there have been many great libraries lost in history,” said Morgan. "And with them, we have lost many wonderful stories."

"That's sad," said Annie.

“It is," said Morgan. "But luckily, with the help of the tree house and you two Master Librarians, some of those stories can be saved. Such as this one——"
Morgan showed them the piece of paper. There was strange writing on it:

​			Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Is that a secret code?” said Jack.

Morgan smiled. “In a way,” she said “Actually, it's the title of a lost story. It's written in Latin, the language of the ancient Romans of Italy."

“Ancient Romans?” said Jack. He loved anything to do with ancient Romans.

“Yes” said Morgan. “This story was in a library in a Roman town. I need you to get it before the library becomes lost forever.”

“No problem!” said Annie.

“Do you have your secret library cards?” asked Morgan.

“Yes," said Jack.

“Good. Do not lose them. The right people will know what they mean," said Morgan. “And, as usual, here is a book to help you."

Morgan handed Jack a book called Life in Roman Times. The cover showed a Roman town with people wearing tunies and sandals.

“That looks great," said Jack.

“And take this the name of the story I need," said Morgan. She handed the piece of paper to Jack, and he put it in his pack.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But remember: In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you. But first you must find it."

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Go now,” Morgan said softly. “And don't forget what I just told you."

“Thanks,” said Jack. He pointed at the cover of the book on Roman times. “I wish we could go there," he said.

The wind started to blow.

“I almost forgot——I'm going to help you blend in!” Morgan shouted above the wind.

“What do you mean?” shouted Jack.

Before Morgan could answer, the tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still..

“Oh, cool,” whispered Annie. “Look at us."



## 2：The End Is Near

Jack opened his eyes. He pushed his glassesinto place.

Morgan was gone. And so were Jack's jeans, T-shirt, sneakers, and backpack.

Instead, he had on a white tunic with a belt, sandals that laced up, and a leather bag.

He looked at Annie. She was dressed the same way. Morgan had made them look just like kids in an ancient Roman town.

“I guess this is what Morgan meant," said Jack, "when she said she'd help us blend in.”

”I feel like Cinderella,” said Annie, "I like these clothes.”

“Yeah,” said Jack, although he felt a little as if he was wearing a dress.

Annie looked out the window.

“It's pretty here," she said.

Jack looked with her. They had landed in a grove of trees. On one side of the grove rose a gentle-looking mountain. On the other, a town sparkled in the sunlight.

“I wonder where we are," said Jack. He opened the book about Roman times. He read aloud:

​				Almost 2000 years ago, on August 24, A.D. 79, the seaside town of Pompeii (pom-PAY) was a typical 				Roman town.
​				Many Romans went there on their vacation. They built large houses called villas and planted groves of 				olive trees along the slopes of amountain called Mount Vesuvius(vuh-S00-vee-us).

Annie kept looking out the window as Jack pulled out his notebook and pencil. He wrote:

​				Vacation in Pompeii 
​				August 24,A D.79
​				houses Called villas

Jack looked out the window again.

“It does look like a nice place to go on vacation," he said.

“We must have landed in one of the olive groves," said Annie.

“Yeah, and that town must be Pompeii,” said Jack.

He looked in the opposite direction. “And that mountain must be Mount Vesuvius.”

Annie shivered. “That name sounds scary," she said.

“Really?” said Jack. "Not to me.” He looked down at his notes.

“Hey! Did you feel that?” said Annie.

“What?" Jack looked up.

“The ground shook. I heard it rumble, too" said Annie.

Jack frowned. “I think you were just dreaming again," he said.

“No, I wasn't,” said Annie. “Something feels wrong about this place. I really think we should go home now.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack,“We have to find that lost story for Morgan. Besides, I've always wanted to see a Roman town."

He threw his notebook and the Roman book into his leather bag. Then he went down the rope ladder.

“Come on!” he called when he stepped onto the ground.

Annie just stared down at him.

“Don't be chicken," he said. He pushed his glasses into place. "Come on. It'll be fun.” 

Annie still didn't move.

What's wrong with her? Jack wondered. Usually I'm the worried one.

“Come on,” he pleaded. “We can't let Morgan down."

Annie let out a big sigh. “Okay, but we'd better find that story fast," she said. Finally she climbed down the rope ladder.

The sun was bright and hot as they took off between the olive trees.

With Mount Vesuvius at their backs, they headed for the town of Pompeii.

“That's weird," said Annie, “I don't hear any birds.”

She was right. The grove was strangely silent.

“Don't worry about it," said Jack. “Maybe they're all at the beach. Come on——let's go over that bridge."

He led the way to a small wooden bridge that crossed a narrow stream. But when they got to the stream, they found it had dried up.

“That's really weird," said Annie.

“Don't worry," said Jack. “It just means there hasn't been much rain."

They crossed the bridge and stepped onto a busy street. It was paved with stone.

People were buying things in the open shops that lined the street. Some looked rushed and busy. Others moved slowly. Kids walked with their parents. Groups of teenagers talked and laughed.

They don't seem very different from people shopping in Frog Creek, Jack thought. Except for the clothes, of conrse.

How will we ever find the ancient lost library?" said Annie glancing around.

“I don't know," said Jack, “Just be on the lookout.”

They walked past shops that had huge jars in them. When Jack looked closely, he saw that they were filled with grain, dried fruit. and olives. Meat hung from the ceilings of some of the stores.

They passed a noisy tavern where people were eating and drinking. A young man played a stringed instrument.

“See, there's nothing to worry about," said Jack. “This place isn't all that different from our time.”

“It's not that," said Annie with a worried look.

“See. there's a barbershop and a shoeshop,” said Jack, pointing.

A boy was getting his hair cut by the barber. A girl was trying on a new pair of sandals with her mother.

“It is kind of like home," Annie agreed. 

They kept walking, until they passed a bakery filled with freshly baked flat breads.

“That bread is like pizza,” said Annie, smiling.

“Yeah," said Jack.

The good smells from the bakery made him feel even more at home. Jack looked at Annie. She was still smiling as they walked on.

Soon they came to a large square filled with people, carts and horses, and more shopping stalls.

“Honey cakes! Stuffed dates! Peacock eggs!" sellers called.

Farmers were selling grapes, garlic, and onions, Fishermen were selling all kinds of fish. A few people stood on boxes, giving speeches to small crowds.

“Hey, I bet this is the forum!” said Jack. He reached in his bag for his book. He flipped through it until he found a picture of the square. He read:

​					The center of a Roman town was called a forum. 
​					The fortm was the main place where people met to sell goods and discuss politics.

“I was right!” said Jack. He pulled out his notebook. He wrote:

​						forum: center of town

“Jack,” whispered Annie. “Jack!” She tugged on his tunic. "Look."

Jack glanced up. Annie nodded toward an old woman who was staring straight at them.

She wore a black cloak. Her gray hair was tangled and wild. She seemed to be missing her teeth.

The woman pointed a bony finger at Jack and Annie.

“The end is near!” she said in a raspy voice. "Go home, strangers!”

“Yikes,” said Annie.

“We'd better get away from her,” said Jack, "before people wonder who we are."

He put away his notebook. Then he and Annie hurried away. The old woman cackled behind them.



## 3：Gladiators!

Jack and Annie hid behind a fruit stall. They waited for a moment, then peered around the corner.

“I don't see her,” said Jack.

“Who was she?” asked Annie.

“I don't know, But she looked nuts to me," said Jack.

“What's the book say about her?” said Annie.

“She won't be in there," said Jack.

“Just look," said Annie.

Jack sighed and pulled out the book again. To his surprise he found a picture of the old woman. He read aloud:

​					In Roman times, there were people who could see into the future and warn others about what 					they saw. 
​					These people were called soothsayers.

“See? She wasn't nuts," said Annie. "She was giving us a warning. Just like my nightmare.”

“Don't pay attention to that stuff," said Jack. “Soothsayers are from olden times. People from our time don't believe in them."

“Well, I do,” said Annie. “I'm sure something bad is about to happen."

Jack sighed. “Come on, we have to keep going. We have to find the lost library. Then we'll leave at once."

“We'd better," said Annie.

They left the fruit stand and kept walking through the forum. Soon they came to a large building. Crowds were streaming in and out of it.

“Is that a library?” said Annie.

“Let's look,” said Jack. He looked in the Roman book. He found a picture of the building and read aloud:

​					Most people in Pompeii did not have a bathtub at home, so they went daily to the Public Baths.
​					Not only did people wash at the baths. but they also swam.played sports, and visited with 					their friends.
“That sounds like going to the pool," said Annie. "But it's not a library. Let's keep walking."

They kept walking, until soon they came to a fancy building with large columns.

“Is that a library?" said Annie. Jack found a picture of the building and read aloud:

​					The people of Pompeli believed that many gods and goddesses ruled the world. 
​					This is the Temple of Jupiter their chief god. In this temple, they prayed to Jupiter and offered 					him gifts. 
​					Today we call the stories about Jupiter and other gods and goddesses "myths."

“My teacher read myths to us," said Jack. “I remember stories about Hercules and Apollo."

“Yeah, my teacher read them, too,” said Annie. “I like stories about Venus and Medusa.”

“Hey, maybe the story we're looking for is a myth," said Jack.

“Right," said Annie. “Come on, hurry. Let's keep looking."

They left the forum and turned onto a wide street. Jack gasped. In front of them was an incredible sight.

Tall warriors with huge muscles were walking in a line. They wore fancy helmets and carried heavy shields.

Soldiers, thought Jack.

Then he saw that the warriors  feet were chained together, and  guard walked with them.

“Gladiators!” he whispered.



## 4：Scary Things

Jack pulled out his book and found a picture of the strong men He read aloud:

​				Gladiators were slaves or criminals who fought in the amphitheater (AM-fuh.thee-uh-ter). 
​				They were forced to fight each other or wild animals like lions or bears, The people of Pompeli 				thought a gladiator fight was great fun.

“That's not fun!” said Annie. "No wonder I think it's weird here.”

“No kidding,” said Jack “That's not like our time at all."

Jack and Annie watched as the guards led the gladiators away. They went towarda building that looked like an outdoor stadium.

“That must be the amphitheater," said Jack. “Let's check it out."

“Oh, all right, but it's not a library," said Annie.

He and Annie started up the street toward the amphitheater. A large crowd had gathered near the entrance. Men and women cheered as the gladiators marched inside.

Jack and Annie started to follow them, but a guard held up his spear.

“No children allowed," he said stiffly. "Run along now."

“Yes, run along! Run for your lives!” came a raspy, hissing voice.

Jack and Annie whirled around. It was the soothsayer. She was waving her bony fingerat them.

“Oh, no! Her again!” said Jack. “Let's get away from here." He started to take off.

“Wait!" said Annie. “I want to talk to her!”

“Are you crazy?" said Jack.

But before he could stop her, Annie ran up to the soothsayer.

Jack watched from a distance as the woman talked to Annie.

“Jack, come here! Quick!” called Annie.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack, He sighed and went over to Annie and the soothsayer.

“Tell him," said Annie.

The woman fixed her gaze on Jack.

“All the streams of Pompeii have dried up," she said.

“Remember the stream near the olive grove?” said Annie.

“So what?” said Jack. “Maybe they just need rain.”

“No" said Annie. “There're more scary things. Tell him."

“All the birds have flown away," the soothsayer said.

Jack just stared at her.

“She said that all the rats left, too," said Annie. “And the cows are making strange noises!”

“But why?” said Jack.

“The sea is boiling hot," the old woman said. “And the ground shakes and speaks.“

“See, I told you!” Annie said to Jack.

“But why are these things happening?” Jack asked the soothsayer.

“Because the end is near," she whispered hoarsely.

"We have to leave now!” said Annie.

“But what about the library?” said Jack.

“What library?” the soothsayer asked

“Show her the story title, Jack," said Annie.

Jack took the piece of paper from his bag. He showed the Latin writing to the soothsayer. "A book with this title is in a library in this town," he said.

“So?” the old woman said.

“So we have to save it!" said Annie. She pulled out her secret library card.

The soothsayer stared for a moment at the card and the shimmering letters on it. Then she smiled warmly at Jack and Annie.

“Yes, I understand now," she said. “The only library I know is in the house of Brutus." She pointed to a large villa at the end of the street. “Look there. Quickly.”

“Will Brutus mind?” said Jack.

“Brutus and his house hold are all in Rome," the soothsayer said. “That is merely their vacation villa."

“But we can't just go in and take something of theirs," said Jack.

The old woman shook her head sadly. “After today, there wil be nothing left in Pompeii," she said. “Nothing at all."

Jack felt a chill go down his spine.

“Go and get what you came here for," said the soothsayer. “Then leave at once.”

“Thanks!” said Jack. He grabbed Annie's hand. "Come on!”

“Thanks!” Annie called to the old woman. “You should leave, too!" she added.

Then Annie and Jack started running to the vacation villa. They ran as fast as they could.



## 5：Books? Books?

Jack and Annie ran up to the front entranceof the villa. Jack pushed the door open.

"Go in. Hurry" said Annie. They slipped into the main hall.

“Hello!” Annie called.

There was no answer. The place seemed empty.

The main hall had a large opening in the ceiling. Below it was a small stone pool filled with water. Jack looked at it carefully.

“Oh, I bet rain comes through the hole," said Jack. “Then it lands in that pool so they can use it for their water.”

He started to take out his notebook to make a note.

“There's no time, Jack!" said Annie. “We have to look in all the rooms for books!” 

“Okay, okay, calm down,” said Jack. He put away his notebook and followed Annie.

“Books? Books?” she said, peering into a room off the hall. She moved to the next room. “Books? Books?” Then she moved onto the next.

Jack trailed behind her. Even though she had already checked the rooms, he took a quick peek in each of them. He wanted to see what a house in Roman times looked like. He'd write notes later.

The first two rooms had wooden beds. The walls had pictures painted on them. The floors were covered with tiny pieces of colored stone.

The third room had a low table with silver dishes on it. Three sloping couches were placed around the table. The couches were covered with pillows.

“This must be the dining room,” said Jack. “People from Roman times. lay down on couches while they ate. Did you know that?”

He looked around for Annie, “Where was she?“

“Jack! Come here!” Annie called.

Jack followed her voice. She was in a garden off the dining room. It had a stone patio, palm trees, and grape vines. In the middle was a pond with a mermaid fountain.Goldfish swam in the water.

“Look, there's another room!" said Annie. She moved to the door of a room off the garden.

She opened the door and peeked inside.

Jack looked with her. Along the walls of the room were long shelves with rolls of paper on them.

“Rats!” said Annie. “No  books.” She closed the door. “No books in this whole villa. Let's get out of here.”

“Just a minute,” said Jack. “I have an idea."

He pulled out his book on Roman times.He found a section called WRITING. He read:

​				Romans used pens made of small reeds.
​				Their ink came partly from the black ink of octopuses. 
​				They wrote their “books” on scrolls of papyrus (puh-PI-rus) paper.

“Aha!” said Jack. “That's a library of scrolls! I bet our ancient lost story is in there!”

## 6: The End Is Here

Jack threw open the door to the room of scrolls. He and Annie rushed in and ran over to the shelves.

Jack pulled out the piece of paper with the Latin title on it:

​				Vir Fortissimus in Mundo

“Okay" he said.“ We have to find the scroll with this title."

They began frantically unrolling scrolls one by one. They were all handwritten in Latin.

“Here it is!” said Annie.

She held up a scroll. The words at the top matched the ones on their paper.

“Yay” said Jack. “I wish I could read Latin so we could find out what the story is."

“Don't think about it now!” said Annie. “Let's go!"

Annie handed the scroll to Jack, then started out of the room.

“Come on," she said. “Bring it!”

“I just want to check and see what the story's about," said Jack.

He put the scroll in the leather bag. Then he flipped through the book on Roman times, looking for a picture of the ancient scroll. In the middle of the book, he found a picture of a volcano erupting over a town. 

Under the picture was written:

​				For 800 years, Mount Vesuvius was a peaceful mountain, rising above the town of Pompeii. 
​				Then, at noon on August 24, A.D. 79, it erupted into a deadly volcano.

“Oh,no,” whispered Jack. “August 24, A.D.79——that's today! Oh, man, what time is it?” He looked around wildly. "Annie!”

She was gone again.

“Annie!”

Jack grabbed the leather bag. Then, clutching the book, he tore out of the seroll room.

“Annie!” he cried.

*What?” Annie appeared at the door to the dining room.

“V-v-volcano!” stuttered Jack.

“What?” said Annie.

“Its——its coming a volcano——at noon!” said Jack.

Annie gasped.

“What time is it?" cried Jack.

“So that’s what the soothsayer meant!" Annie said. "The end is near."

“What time is it?” Jack asked again, He looked around the garden.

He saw something near the mermaid fountain.

“A sundial!” he said. “That's how the Romans told time!”

Jack and Annie raced to the sundial. 

“What time does it say?" said Annie.

“I don't know," said Jack.

His hands shook as he turned the pages of the book. He stopped on a picture of a sundial. It showed examples of different times. Jack looked back and forth from the page to the real sundial in the garden.

“Here!" he said. He had found the one that matched. Jack read the writing under the picture:

​				The shadow on the sundial can hardly be seen at noon.

“Oh, man,” he whispered. He looked at Annie. “The end isn't near,  the end is here.

"Just then he heard a terrible blast. It was the loudest sound he had ever heard.



## 7：The Sky Is Falling

The next thing Jack knew, he was lying on the stone patio. The patio stones were trembling. A rumbling sound came from the ground.

Jack raised his head. Annie was on the ground,too.

“You okay?” said Annie.

Jack nodded.

Everything was shaking and crashing down around them——pots, plants, the mermaid fountain. Water from the goldfish pond sloshed onto the patio and Jack and Annie.

They both jumped up just as roof tiles began falling into the garden.

“We better get inside!" said Jack. He grabbed his leather bag. Then he and Annie stumbled into the scroll library.

Giant cracks split the stone floor as Jack and Annie ran to a window and looked out.

Glowing rocks were bursting through the sky above Mount Vesuvius. The whole top of the mountain had blown off.

“What's happening?” said Annie.

“I’ll check——" said Jack. He pulled out the Roman book. He read aloud from the section about the volcano:

​				When a volcano erupts, hot melted rock called “magma" is pushed to the surface of the earth. 
​				Once it ges outside the volcano, it's called “lava."

“Lava! That‘s like burning mud!” said Jack.

“It covers everything!” cried Annie.

Jack kept reading:

​				There was no running lava from Mount Vesuvius.
​				The magma from the volcano cooled so fast that it froze into small grayish white rocks called 				pumice(PUM.s). A pumice rock is very light and has holes like a sponge.

That doesn't sound too bad," said Annie. 

“Wait, there's more” said Jack. He read on:

​				A great cloud of pumice, ash, and burning rock shot miles into the air.
​				When it rained down on Pompeii, it completely buried the town.

“Oh, man," said Jack. “This is a major disaster!”

“It's getting dark," said Annie.

Jack looked out again. A thick black cloud was spreading over the earth like an umbrella. The sun vanished as the sky turned smoky gray.

“That must be the cloud of pumice and ash!” said Jack.

Just then the ground trembled again. Chunks of plaster from the ceiling fell on the scrolls.

"We have to get out of here!" said Annie.

They ran from the scroll library into the garden. Ash and pumice began to fall.

“We have to cover our heads!” said Jack.

They hurried from the garden into the dining room.

“Look! Pillows!” said Annie. “Let's put them on our heads!”

They hurried to the couches beside the table and each grabbed a pillow.

“Tie it around your head with your belt!” said Jack.

They both pulled off the belts from around their tunics. Then they tied on the pillows like giant hats.

A chunk of ceiling crashed down near them.

“Let's get out of here!” said Jack.

They stepped over pieces of fallen roof tiles and ran into the main hall. They pushed open the front door.

A blast of heat and dust nearly knocked them over. And when they stepped outside. pumice rained down onto their pillow hats.

“Run!” cried Annie.

They ran from the vacation villa into the dark, burning streets.





## 8：Nightmare at Noon

In the distance, fire burst from Mount Vesuvius, Burning rocks and fiery ash fell from the sky.

The hot, dusty air smelled like rotten eggs as Jack and Annie rushed down the street. In the forum, everyone shoppers, soldiers, gladiators, fruit sellers——was running in every direction.

Stalls had collapsed. Carts were sliding.

Jack froze. He didn't know where to go.

“That way!" shouted Annie.

Jack followed her as they ran past the Temple of Jupiter. Its mighty columns had fallen, and its walls were crumbling.

They ran past the Public Baths just as its roof caved in.

“Which way now?” shouted Annie.

“The tree house is in the olive grove!” Jack said as they kept running.

“The olive grove and the bridge are near the street with all those open shops!” said Annie. “Remember the bridge?”

Jack looked up at the erupting mountain. A red-hot cloud billowed over it. Fires burned on its slopes.

“Head in the direction of Mount Vesuvius!” he said. “lt was behind us as we came into Pompeii."

“Right!” cried Annie.

So while others ran away from Mount Vesuvius. Jack and Annie ran toward it.

On the street with the open shops, baskets and broken jars rolled over the cracked stones.

Jack and Annie ran past the bakery and the shoe shop. They ran past the butcher shop and barbershop. All the shops were empty. Their owners had fled.

The closer they got to the volcano, the more the ground trembled. The darker and dustier it got.

“This is just like my nightmare!” cried Annie.

Jack choked on the rotten fumes. His eyes watered.

“Look! The olive grove!” shouted Annie.

The tree house is just over there! Come on!” Jack could hardly see, but he followed Annie. They left the street and ran to the dried-up stream near the olive grove.

“Where's the bridge? cried Annie. They looked around wildly. The bridge had vanished.



## 9：Save Us!

“The bridge must have caved in!” cried Annie.

They stared at the dried-up stream. Pumice had piled up in huge drifts, like snow.

“We'll have to get through that stuff to get across!” said Jack.

He and Annie slid down the bank onto the piles of pumice. As they started to move across it, more and more fell.

Jack tried to move through the millions of warm, grayish white pebbles. But he was trapped.

“I'm stuck!” cried Annie.

“Me too!” said Jack.

“Remember what Morgan said!” said Annie.

At the moment, Jack couldn't remember anything. He was too tired and dazed.“

“In your darkest hour, only the ancient story can save you!” cried Annie. “Where's your bag?”

Jack lifted his bag into the air, above the sea of pumice. Annie grabbed it and pulled out the ancient scroll. She held it up to the dark sky.

"Save us, story!" she shouted.

Jack felt himself sink deeper and deeper into the pumice. Suddenly he heard a deep voice say, “Rise, son!”

Then someone lifted Jack up into  the air.

A great flash of fire lit the dusty darkness. In the red light, Jack saw the biggest,strongest man he'd ever seen in his life. The man looked like a gladiator——but even bigger than the ones they had seen earlier.

He held Jack with one hand and Annie with the other. He placed them both on the other bank of the stream.

“Run!” the giant gladiator boomed. “Before it's too late!”

Jack and Annie didn't stop to ask any questions. Together, they charged through the olive grove.

They jumped over fallen branches. They leaped over great cracks in the earth. Finally they came to the tree with the magic tree house.

They grabbed the rope ladder and scrambled up to the tree house.

Where's the Pennsylvania book?” Jack shouted. He was too blinded by ash and dust to find the book that always took them home.

“I've got it!” cried Annie.“I wish we could go there!”

Jack felt the tree house start to spin.

It spun faster and faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely, wonderfully, peacefully still.



## 10：A Simple Explanation

Jack didn't move. He had never been so tired in all his life.

“Breathe,” said Annie. Jack gulped in cool, clean air. He opened his eyes. He couldn't see a thing.

“Take off your glasses," said Annie. They're filthy."

Jack took off his glasses. The first thing he saw was his backpack. The white tunics and lace-up sandals were gone. So were their pillow hats and the leather bag.

Jack let out a long, deep breath. As he cleaned his glasses on his shirt, a voice came from behind him. 

“I'm very glad to see you safe and sound." Morgan le Fay stood in the corner of the tree house. She looked as lovely and mysterious as ever.

“Happy to be home?” she asked.

Jack nodded. The sound of the erupting volcano still echoed in his ears.

“It——it was pretty scary,” he said in a hoarse voice.

“I know. But you were truly brave," said Morgan. “You witnessed a famous event in history. Nowadays, scientists study the remains of Pompeii to find out more about Roman times.

“I feel bad for all those people,” said Annie.

“Yes,” said Morgan. "But most of the people of Pompeii did escape. The city wasn't completely buried by ash until the next day.”

“We were almost trapped,” said Annie. “But we asked the ancient story to save us. Then a huge gladiator helped us."

Jack reached into his pack. He breathed asigh of relief. The scroll was still there! He took it out. It was covered with dust and ashes.

“Here's the story" said Jack.

He handed it to Morgan.

“I am deeply grateful," she said softly. “You risked everything to bring this to me. I can never thank you enough.”

“Don't worry about it,” said Jack. He didn't want Morgan to know how scared he had been.

“Yeah, no problem," said Annie.

Morgan smiled. “You are amazing MasterLi brarians," she said. "Do you think you're up to rescuing another ancient story?”

“Yes!” said Annie.

“Now?” said Jack. Actually he was a little tired now.

Morgan laughed. “No. Take a nice vacation. Come back two weeks from today. Then you will take a trip to ancient China," she said.

“Ancient China? Wow,” said Annie.

“Oh, man," said Jack.

“Go home now and rest," said Morgan. She handed Jack his pack. 

“Thanks,"” he said. “Bye."

“Bye," said Annie.

Morgan gave them a little wave. Then Annie and Jack left the tree house and headed down the rope ladder. When they reached the ground, Jack looked up.

“Morgan," he called. “What is that story about——the one we just rescued?”

“It's called The Strongest Man in the World," said Morgan. “It's a lost tale about Hercules."

“Hercules?” said Jack.

“Yes, he was one of the heroes of the Greeks and the Romans,” said Morgan. "He was a son of Jupiter."

“Oh, wow. Now l get it," said Annie.

“I’m taking it back now to Camelot's library." said Morgan. “Everyone will be so excited to read it, thanks to you." She waved to them. “Good-bye for now!”

As she waved, the wind began to whirl. The tree house began to spin. In a blur of shadow and light, Morgan and the magic tree house were gone.

Jack and Annie started walking through the woods.

“Get it? Get it?” said Annie.

“Get what?” said Jack.

“We were saved by Hercules!” said Annie. We asked the story to save us——and Hercules appeared!”

”That's not possible,” said Jack. “It was just some gladiator guy. The story of Herculesis a myth, That means he never really lived."

They left the woods and started up their street.

“I know it's a myth,” said Annie. "But l have a simple explanation.”

“What?” said Jack.

“Hercules is a myth to people in this time," said Annie. "But in Roman times, lots of people believed he was real. So, since we were in Roman times, he was real to us."

“I don't know ..."said Jack.

“Did you ever hear the saying?” said Annie. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

Jack laughed. “Yeah.” He looked up at the sky. “Thanks, Hercules,” he said softly, “whatever you are."

“Jack! Annie!” their dad called from their front porch. “Time to go!”

“Oh, brother, I forgot," said Jack. “Yeah, I hope nothing exciting happens on our vacation," ”said Annie.

“Yeah,” said Jack. “I hope it's really, really boring."

“Hurry!" their dad said.

“Coming!" they called.

Then they took off running for home and a restful vacation.

# Day of the Dragon King

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books. 

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morganis a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She through time and space, gathering books.

In Magic Tree House #12, Polar Bears Past Bedtime, Jack and Annie solved the last of four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the letters M L on them.

Jack and Annie's first four missions as Master Librarians are to save stories from ancient libraries. When their first adventure ended (Magic Tree House #13, Vacation Under the Volcano), Morgan asked them to return to the tree house in two weeks to go to China and save another story.
Now the two weeks are over...



## 1：The Bamboo Book

Annie peeked into Jack's room.

“Ready to go to China? she asked. 

Jack took a deep breath. 

“Sure," he answered.

“Bring your secret library card,” Annie said. “I have mine in my pocket."

“Yep," said Jack.

He opened his top dresser drawer and took out a thin wooden card, The letters M L on it shimmered in the light. Jack dropped the card into his backpack. Then he threw in his notebook and a pencil.

“Let's go," said Annie.

Jack pulled on his pack and followed her.

“What are we in for today? he wondered. 

“Bye, Mom!” said Annie as they passed their mom in the kitchen.

“Where are you going?" she asked.

“China!” said Annie.

“Great,” said their mom. She winked at them. “Have fun.”

Fun? thought Jack. He was afraid that fun wasn't quite the right word.

“Just wish us luck," he said as he and Annie headed out the front door.

"Good luck!” their mother called.

“If only she knew we aren't pretending,” Jack whispered to Annie.

“Yeah," said Annie, grinning.

Outside, the sun shone brightly. Birds sang. Crickets chirped. Jack and Annie walked up their street toward the Frog Creek woods.

“I wonder if the weather will be this nice in China,” Annie said.

“I don't know. Remember, Morgan said this would be a very scary adventure," said Jack.

“They're always scary,” said Annie. “But we always meet animals who help us, or people.”

“True," said Jack.

“I bet we meet someone great today," said Annie.

Jack smiled. He was starting to feel excited now instead of seared.

“Let's hurry!" he said.

They ran into the Frog Creek woods. They slipped between the tall trees until they came to a huge oak.

“Hello!" came a soft voice they knew well.

They looked up. Morgan was peering down from the magic tree house. 

“Ready for your next mission as Master Librarians?” she asked.

“Yes!" said Jack and Annie. They grabbed the rope ladder and started up.

"Are we still going to China?” asked Annie when they had climbed into the tree house.

“Indeed,” said Morgan. “You're going to ancient China. Here is the title of the story you must find."

She held up a long, thin strip of wood. It looked like a ruler, except it had strange writing on it instead of numbers.

“Long ago, the Chinese discovered how to make paper. It was one of the world's most important discoveries,” said Morgan. “But you are going to a time earlier than that, to a time when books were written on bamboo strips like this one.”

“Wow," said Annie, pointing at the figures on the bamboo."So this is Chinese writing?”

“Yes,” said Morgan. “Just as we have letters, Chinese writing is made up of many characters. Each one stands for a different thing or idea. These characters are the title of an ancient Chinese legend. You must find the first writing of the legend before the Imperial Library is destroyed."

“Hurry, let's go," said Annie.

“Wait, we need our research book,” saidJack.

“Yes, you do," said Morgan. From the folds of her robe, she pulled out a book. On the cover was the title: The Time of the First Emperor.

Morgan handed the book to Jack. 

“This research book will guide you," she said. “But remember, in your darkest hour only the old legend can save you.

“But we have to find it first," said Annie. 

“Exactly," said Morgan.

She handed Jack the bamboo strip, and he slipped it into his pack.

Jack pushed his glasses into place, then pointed at the cover of their research book.

“I wish we could go there!” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin. 

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 2：The Cowherd

“Oh, wow,” Annie said. “These clothes feel so soft. And look, I have a pocket for my secret library card.”

Jack opened his eyes. Their clothes had magically changed.

They no longer wore jeans, T-shirts, and sneakers. Instead, they had on baggy pants, loose shirts, straw shoes, and round hats. Annie’s shirt had a pocket in it.

Jack saw that his backpack had become a rough cloth sack. Inside were his researchbook, his notebook, his library card, and the bamboo strip.

“Cows,” said Annie, looking out the window.

Jack looked out, too. The tree house had landed in a lone tree in a sunny field. Cows grazed, and a young man stood watching over them. At the edge of the field was a farmhouse. Beyond the house was a walled city.

“It looks so peaceful," said Annie.

“You can never be sure," said Jack. “Remember, Pompeii looked peaceful before the volcano went off."

“Oh, yeah," said Annie.

"Let's see what the book says," said Jack. He reached in the sack and pulled out the China book. He opened it and read aloud:

​				Over 2,000 years ago, China was ruled by its first emperor. 
​				Because he chose the dragon to be his symbol, he was called the "Dragon King." 
​				In China, dragons are seen as brave and powerful creatures.

“Dragon King? That sounds a little scary,” said Jack.

“I like his outfit," said Annie.

Next to the writing was a picture. It showed a man wearing a rich, flowing robe with wide sleeves. He also wore a tall hat with beads hanging from it.

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​				first emperor called Dragon King

“The book we need must be in the Dragon King's library," said Annie. "I bet his palace is in that city."

Jack looked up.

“Right," he said. “And that's how to get there.” He pointed across the field to a dirt road that led to the walled city.

“Good plan," said Annie.

She climbed out of the tree house and started down the rope ladder.

Jack threw the China book and his notebook into his sack. He slung the sack over his shoulder and followed Annie.

When they reached the ground, they started through the field.

“Look, that guy's waving at us,” said Annie.

The man tending the cows was shouting and waving. He started running toward them.

“Uh-oh, what's he want?” said Jack.

A moment later, the man stood in their path. He was young and handsome with a kind face.

"“Can you do me a great favor?" he asked. “I would be most grateful.” 

"Of course," said Annie.

“Give a message to the silk weaver. You will see her at the farmhouse," said the youngman. “Tell her to meet me here at twilight.”

“Sure, no problem," said Annie.

The young man smiled.

“Thank you," he said. Then he started to leave.

“Wait, excuse me——” said Jack. “Do you know where we can find the Imperial Library?”

A look of horror crossed the man's kind face.

”Why?" he whispered.

“Oh, I-I just wondered," said Jack.

The young man shook his head.

“Beware of the Dragon King," he said. “Whatever you do, beware."

Then he turned and ran back to his cows.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. “Now we know one thing for sure."

“What?” asked Annie.

“This place is not as peaceful as it seems,” Jack said.



## 3：The Silk Weaver

Jack and Annie kept walking across the pasture toward the road. Annie stopped when they neared the farmhouse.

“We have to find the silk weaver and give her the message," she said.

“Let's do that on our way back," said Jack.“I'm worried about finding the Imperial Library."

“What if we don't have time?" said Annie. “We promised. And he was so nice."

Jack sighed.

“Okay," he said. “But let's find her fast. And remember to keep your head down so no one will notice us.”

Jack and Annie bowed their heads as they headed toward the house.

As they got closer, Jack peeked out from under his hat. An ox pulled a cart filled with hay. Men hoed the ground. Women pushed wheelbarrows piled high with grain.

“There!” said Annie. She pointed to an open porch where a young woman was weaving cloth on a loom. "That must be her!”

Annie ran to the silk weaver. Jack looked around to see if anyone was watching. Luckily. all the farmworkers seemed too busy to notice anything. Still looking around carefully, Jack walked toward the porch.

Annie was already talking to the silk weaver.

“What did he say?” the young woman asked. Her voice was soft but strong. Her dark eyes glowed with happiness.

“He said you should meet him in the field at twilight” said Annie. “He's so handsome!” 

“Yes, he is." The silk weaver gave Annie a shy smile. Then she reached down to a basket near her loom and picked up a ball of yellow thread.

“It was very brave of you to bring the message,” she said. “Please accept this silk thread as my thank-you."

She handed Annie the ball of silk. “It's beautiful,” said Annie. “Feel."

She handed it to Jack. The thread was smooth and soft.

“How do you make silk?" said Jack.

“It is made from the cocoons of silkworms,” said the weaver.

“Really? Worms? That's neat" said Jack. “Let me write that down." 

He reached into his sack.

“Please don't!” said the silk weaver. "The making of silk is China's most valuable secret. Anyone who steals the secret will be arrested. The Dragon King will have him put to death."

“Oops,” said Jack.

He dropped the ball of silk into his sack.

“I think you must leave quickly,” whispered the silk weaver. “You have been seen."

”Jack looked over his shoulder. A man was pointing at them.

“Let's go," he said.

“Bye!” said Annie. “Good luck on your date!"

“Thank you" the silk weaver said.

“Come on,” said Jack.

They hurried away from the silk weaver.

“Stop!” someone shouted.

“Run!” said Annie.

## 4：The Great Wall

Jack and Annie ran around the farmhouse. At the back was an oxcart filled with bags of grain. There was no one in sight.

The shouting behind them got louder.

Jack and Annie looked at each other, then dived into the back of the wooden cart. They buried themselves in the middle of the bags of grain.

Jack's heart pounded as the shouts came closer. He held his breath and waited for the people to leave.

Suddenly the cart lurched forward. Someone was driving them away!

Jack and Annie peeked over the bags. Jack saw the back of the driver. He was calmly steering the oxcart over the dirt road. They were on their way to the walled city!

Jack and Annie ducked down again. This is great!” whispered Annie. “All we have to do is jump out when we get into the city.”

“Yep,” Jack said softly. “Then we'll find the Imperial Library, find the book, and get back to the magie tree house."

“No problem,” whispered Annie.

“Whoa!” The cart slowly came to a halt.

Jack held his breath. He heard voices and the heavy tramping of feet——lots of feet. He and Annie peeked out.

“Oh, man," he whispered.

A long line of men was crossing the road in front of the cart. They carried axes, shovels and hoes. Guards marched alongside them.

“Let's find out what's happening,” said Jack.

He reached into his sack and pulled out the China book. Pushing his glasses into place, he found a picture of the workers. He read:

​			The Dragon King forced many of his subjects to start building a wall to protect China from invaders.
​			Later emperors made the wall even longer.
​			Finally, it stretched 3,700 miles along China's border. The Great Wall of Chinais the longest structure 			ever built.

“Wow, the Great Wall of China," said Jack.

“I've heard of that," said Annie.

“Who hasn't?” said Jack. “Those guys are going to work on it right now."

Just then, someone grabbed Jack and Annie. They looked up. It was the driver of the cart.

“Who are you?” he asked angrily.

“We—uh—”Jack didn't know what to say.

The man's gaze fell on the open book in Jack's hands. His mouth dropped open. He let go of Jack and Annie. Slowly he reached out and touched the book. He looked back at Jack and Annie with wide eyes.

“What is this?” he said.

## 5：The Scholar

“It's a book from our country,” said Jack. “Your books are made of bamboo, but ours are made of paper. Actually, your country invented paper. But later in the future.”

The man looked confused.

“Never mind,” said Annie. “It's for reading. It's for learning about faraway places."

The man stared at them. Tears filled his eyes.

“What's wrong?” Annie asked softly.

“I love reading and learning," he said.

“So do I," said Jack.

The man smiled. “You don't understand! I am dressed as a farmer,” he said. “But in truth, I am a scholar!”

“What's a scholar?” said Annie.

We are great readers, learners, and writers,” he said. “We have long been the most honored citizens in China."

The scholar's smile faded.

“But now scholars are in danger," he said. “And many of us have gone into hiding."

“Why?” said Jack.

The Dragon King is afraid of the power of our books and learning," said the scholar. "He wants people to think only what he wants them to think. Any day he may order the burning of the books!

Annie gasped.

“Does that mean what I think it means?” said Jack.

The scholar nodded.

“All the books in the Imperial Library will be burned," he said.

“That's rotten!" said Annie.

“Indeed it is!" the scholar said quietly.

“Listen, we have a mission to get a book from that library,”  said Jack.

“Who are you?” asked the scholar.

“Show him," said Annie.

She reached into her shirt pocket as Jack reached into his sack. They brought out the secret library cards.

The letters shimmeredin the sunlight.

The scholar's mouth dropped open again.

“You are Master Librarians,” he said. “I have never met ones to honored who were so yound.”

He bowed to show his respect.

“Thank you,” said Jack and Annie.

They bowed back to him.

“How can I help you?” asked the scholar.

“We need to go to the Imperial Library and find this book," said Jack.

He held out Morgan's bamboo strip to the scholar.

“We will go to the Imperial Library," said the scholar. “As for the story, I know it well. It is a true one, written not long ago. But I warn you. We will be in great danger.“

“We know!” said Annie.

The scholar smiled.

“I am happy to be doing something I believe in again,” said the scholar. “Let us go.”

They all climbed into the front of the cart. The long line of wall builders was marching in the distance. As the oxen started forward the scholar turned to Jack and Annie.

“Where are you from?" he asked.

“Frog Creek, Pennsylvania," said Annie. “I have never heard of it," said the scholar. “Do they have a library there?”

“Oh, sure, there's a library in every town,” said Jack. “In fact, there are probably thousands of libraries in our country.”

“And millions of books, said Annie. “And no one burns them."

“Right," said Jack. “Everyone gets to go to school to learn to read them."

The scholar stared at him and shook his head.

“It sounds like paradise," he said.



## 6：The Dragon King

The oxcart bumped across the wooden bridge that crossed over a moat. Then it passed guards standing by giant wooden gates.

“Are the gates ever closed?" Jack asked.

“Oh, yes, every day at sunset,” said the scholar. “When the gong sounds, the gates close. The bridge comes up. And the city is sealed shut for the night."

“I guess visitors have to leave before that happens,” Annie said. “Or they'll be stuck here for the whole night. Right?”

“Yes," said the scholar.

The cart bumped between the city gates.

Rows of small houses were bunched together on either side of the street. They were made of mud with straw roofs. People cooked over outdoor fires. They washed their clothes in wooden tubs.

As the oxcart bumped along, the houses got larger. These were made of painted wood and pottery tiles. They all had curved roofs.

“Why are those roofs like that?" asked Jack. 

“To keep away the bad spirits," said the scholar.

“How do they do that?” said Annie.

“The spirits can only travel in straight lines,” said the scholar.

“Wow,” whispered Annie. The cart went by some open tea shops. Then it passed a large market square filled with stalls and shoppers. People were buyingand selling fish, chickens, firewood, wagon wheels, silk cloth, furs, and jade jewelry.

Some people were lined up at a stall filled with tiny cages.

“What's for sale there?” said Annie.

“Crickets," the scholar said. "They make good pets. You can feed them tea leaves and enjoy their delicate song."

The cart moved on toward the Dragon King's walled palace. They stopped in front of the palace gates.

“Grain delivery!” the scholar shouted upto the guard at the tower.

The guard waved them through. Inside were beautiful gardens and huge mounds of earth surrounded by a low brick wall.

“That is the Imperial Burial Grounds,” said the scholar, pointing at the mounds. 

“Who is buried there?" asked Jack.

The ancestors of the Dragon King,” said the scholar.

“What are ancestors?” Annie asked.

“They are the people in your family who lived before you," said the scholar. “Someday the Dragon King himself will be buried there. Three hundred thousand workers have been building his burial tomb."

“Oh, man," said Jack. He looked over his shoulder at the burial grounds. He wondered why it took so many workers to build a tomb.

“No!" said the scholar.

Jack whirled around.

“What's wrong?" he asked.

The scholar pointed at the palace courtyard. A dark cloud of smoke was rising into the sky.

“Fire!" said the scholar.

“The books!” said Jack.

“Hurry!" said Annie.

The scholar snapped the reins. The oxen trotted up the stone path. When the cart rolled into the courtyard, soldiers were everywhere.

Some threw wood on a huge bonfire. Others were carrying bamboo strips down the steep stairs that led from the palace.

“Are those books?” asked Jack.

“Yes. The strips are tied together into different bundles" moaned the scholar.“ Each bundle is a book."

"Look!” said Annie, pointing to the palace entrance.

Stepping outside was a man in a rich,flowing robe and a tall hat. Jack knew him at once——the Dragon King!



## 7：The Burning of the books

The Dragon King watched the bonfire as it blazed up toward the sky. Around the fire the air was thick and wavy. Bamboo books were stacked beside the fire, waiting to be burned. 

“Hurry!" said the scholar. They jumped down from the cart and joined the crowd by the bonfire. 

The Dragon King shouted to the soldiers. They began throwing the books into the fire. The bamboo crackled as it burned.

“Stop!” cried Annie.

Jack grabbed her.

"Quiet!" he said.

Annie pulled away.

“Stop!” she shouted again. But her voice was lost in the noise of the roaring fire.

“There's your story!" said the scholar.

He pointed to a bamboo book that had fallen off a waiting stack.

“I'll get it!” said Annie.

She dashed over to the book.

“Annie!” cried Jack.

But she had already snatched up the bundle of bamboo strips and was charging back to them.

“Got it! Quick, put it in your sack!" she said. 

Jack put the bundle of bamboo strips in his sack. Then he looked around fearfully. He gasped.

The Dragon King was glaring at them! Then he headed their way.

“Seize them!" the Dragon King shouted.

“Run through the burial grounds!” the scholar said to Jack and Annie. “The soldiers will be afraid to follow. They fear the spirits of the ancestors!”

“Thanks!” said Jack, “Thanks for everything!”

“Good luck!” cried Annie.

Then she and Jack took off. Soldiers shouted after them. An arrow whizzed by.

But Jack and Annie kept running. They ran down the path to the burial grounds. They jumped over the low brick wall and ran between the huge mounds of earth.

Suddenly arrows filled the air around them. The archers were shooting from the tower!

“Look!” cried Jack.

There was a doorway in one of the mounds. Jack and Annie ducked inside.

They were in a long hall lit with oil lamps. 

“It's so quiet,” said Annie. She walked down the passageway. "Hey, there are some steps here.”

“Don't go any farther!" said Jack.

“Why not?” said Annie.

“We don't know what's down there," saidJack."This is a burial tomb, remember? It's creepy."

“Let's just take a quick look,” said Annie. “Maybe it's the way out of here." 

Jack took a deep breath.

“You might be right," he said. "Okay, but go slow” He didn't want to stumble upon a dead body.

Annie started down the steep steps. Jack followed. The lamps lit their way as they kept going down and down. Finally, they reached the bottom.

Jack blinked. Even though oil lamps glowed everywhere, it was hard to see at first.

When Jack's eyes got used to the strange light, his heart nearly stopped.

“Oh, man," he breathed. 

They were in a room filled with soldiers——thousands of them.

 

## 8：The Tomb

Jack and Annie stood frozen.

The silent soldiers did, too.

Finally, Annie spoke.

”They're fake," she said.

“Fake?" whispered Jack.

“They're not real," she said.

”They look real，" said Jack.

Annie walked straight toward the front row of soldiers.

Jack held his breath.

Annie pulled the soldier's nose.

“Fake!” she said.

“Oh, brother,” said Jack. He walked over to the soldier and touched his painted face. It was as hard as stone.

“It's amazing," Jack said.

Annie nodded. “It's like a museum.”

She walked down a row between two lines of soldiers.

“Wait. This is spooky,” said Jack. “What is this place?”

He put down his sack and pulled out the China book. He found a picture of the frozen army and read aloud:

​				The Dragon King had 7,000 life-size clay figures made for his burial tomb.
​				The clay was baked and painted.
​				The Dragon King hoped that the clay army would protect him after he died.

“It's like the pyramid in ancient Egypt," said Jack. “Remember? The queen was buried with a boat and lots of things to take to the after life” He looked around. “Annie?”

“I'm here,” she called. She was far down another row.

“Come back here," yelled Jack.

“No, you come here,” said Annie. “It's so cool. All their faces are different."

Jack threw the book into his sack, Then he hurried down the row to Annie.

“Look," she said. “Just look."

In the flickering lamp light, they wandered down the rows of soldiers. No two soldiers had the same nose, the same eyes, or the same mouth.

“Oh, man. No wonder so many people had to work on this tomb." said Jack.

“They really did a good job,” said Annie.

“Yeah," said Jack.

There were kneeling archers and foot soldiers dressed in red and black armor.

There were real bronze swords, daggers, axes, spears, bows,and arrows.

There were even life-size wooden chariots with horses. The horses looked completely real. They were different colors with white teeth and red tongues.

“I have to take some notes about all this," said Jack.

He pulled out his notebook and pencil. Then, kneeling on the brick floor, he wrote:

​				no two faces the same
​				not even the horses



“Ja-ack," said Annie. “You know what?”

“What?”

“I think we're lost," she said.

“Lost?” Jack stood up. “We're not lost"

“Yeah? Then which way is out?” said Annie.

Jack looked around. All he could see were rows of soldiers, In front of them, to the right, to the left, behind them——nothing but clay soldiers.

“Which way did we come?” said Annie.

“I don't know,” said Jack.

All the rows looked the same. They stretched out endlessly.

Jack tried not to panic.

“I'd better look this up," he said.

“Forget it," said Annie. “Morgan said there search book would guide us. But in our darkest hour, only the ancient legend would save us.”

“Is this our darkest hour?” asked Jack.

Annie nodded. “Yeah, it's pretty dark.”

It does seem to be getting darker in here, thought Jack. The air was getting thicker. too. It seemed harder to breathe.

“Let's ask for help," said Jack.

He reached into the sack and pulled out the bamboo book. He held it up and said, “Save us!”

As Jack waited, the tomb seemed unbearably quiet.

Jack held the book up again. "Please help us find our way out," he said.

He and Annie kept waiting. But nothing happened.

The air was growing even thicker. The light was getting dimmer. The countless rows of soldiers seemed creepier.

Help did not come.

Jack felt faint. “I——I guess we'll just have——have to——”

“Look!” Annie said.

“What?”

The ball of thread! It rolled out of your sack!" she said.

”So what?” said Jack.

He looked at his cloth sack lying on the floor. The ball of yellow silk thread had rolled out. And it was still rolling, leaving a trail of yellow thread!



## 9：The Silk Path

“What's going on?" said Jack.

“I don't know” said Annie. “But we'd better follow it.”

She hurried after the ball of silk thread.

Jack put the bamboo book into his sackand took off after her.

They followed the trail of thread down the row, where it turned down another row. 

“Hey, that's impossible!" said Jack. “That's scientifically impossible!”

“I told you, it's magic!” cried Annie.

Jack couldn't believe it. But he kept following the thread.

Suddenly the trail of thread was gone. The ball had completely unrolled.

Jack and Annie stood still for a moment and caught their breath.

“What-what now?” said Jack.

“I guess we go up those stairs," Annie said.

“What stairs?" said Jack.

“There"

Jack looked through the dim light and saw the entrance to a stairway only a few feet away.

“Let's get out of here!" he said.

They ran up the stairs. At the top, they saw that they were in the hall that led to the entrance of the mound.

They walked and walked and walked down the lamp-lit passage. Finally, Jack stopped.

“I don't remember this hall being so long," he said.

“Me neither,” said Annie. “I guess those weren't the same stairs that we went down.”

“What should we do now?” said Jack.

“We'd better keep going,” said Annie.

“Yeah, we don't have much choice,"” said Jack.

They started walking again. They rounded a corner and came to a door.

“Oh, great!" said Annie.

“Wait. We don't know what's on the other side," said Jack. "Go slow. Be careful."

“Okay,” said Annie.

Slowly and carefully, she opened the door. Then she peeked out.

“Yippee," she said softly.

Annie stepped into the fading daylight.

Jack stepped out after her.

The sun had gone down.

They were standing outside the gate of the Dragon King's palace. They could see the market not far away. The stalls were closing for the day.

“We're safe!” said Annie.

Jack breathed a huge sigh of relief.

Just then, a gong sounded. It was coming from the tower of the city walls!

“Oh, man! They're going to close the gates!" said Jack.

He clutched his sack as they took off. They charged up the street. They ran past the market. They ran past the rich houses...past the poor houses.

Their straw shoes fell off. But Jack and Annie kept running barefoot.

Just as the giant wooden gates started to close, they tore through them.

 They charged across the bridge and kept running up the dirt road, past the farmhouse and through the field.

By the time they reached their tree, Jack's lungs ached. His heart pounded. His feet burned.

He followed Annie up the rope ladder. When they got inside the tree house, Jack collapsed.

“Let's——go——home," he said, out of breath. 

He reached for the Pennsylvania book. 

”Wait,” said Annie, looking out the window. “They found each other."

“Who——found——who?” said Jack, panting.

He dragged himself to the window and looked out.

Two figures embraced at the edge of the field.

“The silk weaver and the man who takes care of the cows!" said Annie.

“Oh, yeah," said Jack.

”Bye!” Annie called to them.

The couple waved back.

Annie sighed happily.

“We can leave now," she said.

Jack opened the Pennsylvania book and pointed at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“I wish we could go there" he said.

The wind started to blow.

Jack looked out one last time at the Chinese couple. They seemed to be glowing like stars.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：The Ancient Legend

Jack opened his eyes. He was wearing his own clothes and his sneakers. The cloth sack had turned back into his backpack.

“Welcome home, Master Librarians,” said Morgan.

She stood in the tree house, smiling at them.

“Hi!" said Annie.

”We brought you the ancient legend," said Jack.

“Wonderful!” said Morgan.

Jack reached into his pack. He took out the China book. Then he pulled out the bamboo book. He handed them to Morgan.

”What's the legend about?” said Annie.

“It's called The Silk Weaver and the Cowherd,” said Morgan. "It's a very famous Chinese tale.”

“Guess what, Morgan?” said Annie.“We actually met them! We helped them get together!”

“Oh, did you?" said Morgan.

"Yes!” said Jack. The silk weaver's ball of silk saved us!”

“What does the legend say about them?” asked Annie.

“It says that long ago they were heavenly beings who lived in the sky," said Morgan. When they came to earth, they fell in love.”

"That's when we met them!" said Annie.

“Yes, I imagine so," said Morgan. "The book you brought back tells about their happiness on earth. But I'm afraid a later legend tells us that when they returned to the sky, the king and queen of the skies separated them by a heavenly river called the Milky Way."

“Oh, no," said Annie.

“They get back together once a year," said Morgan. "On that night, birds make a bridge in the sky over the Milky Way."

Jack and Annie gazed up at the bright summer sky.

“Go home now,” said Morgan. “Come back two weeks from today. Next you're going to find a book in the country of Ireland, over a thousand years ago."

“That sounds like fun," said Annie.

Morgan frowned.

“I'm afraid it was a very dangerous time," she said. “For Viking raiders often attacked the seacoasts.”

“Vikings?” said Jack. He'd had enough danger to last a long time.

“Don't worry about it now,” said Morgan. Just go home and rest.”

Jack nodded.

“I’ll try,” he said, pulling on his backpack.

“Bye,” said Annie. “See you in two weeks."

“Thank you for your help," said Morgan.

“Anytime," said Annie.

They headed down the rope ladder.

From the ground, they waved to Morgan.

Then they started for home.

As they got to the edge of the woods, Annie stopped.

“Listen to the crickets," she said.

Jack listened. The cricket chirps sounded louder than usual.

“Their ancestors lived in the time of the Dragon King" said Annie.

“Oh, brother," said Jack.

“Right now the grownups are telling the little crickets a legend," said Annie.

“Yeah, sure," said Jack.

“A legend passed down from their ancestors," said Annie.

Jack smiled. He didn't want to admit it. but the cricket noise did sound like storytelling. He could almost hear them saying, Dragon King, Dragon King, Dragon King.

“Jack! Annie!” came a voice.

It was their mother calling them.

The spell was broken. The cricket stories were just plain old cricket sounds again.

“Coming!” Jack shouted.

Jack and Annie ran down their street and across their yard.

“Did you have a good time in China?” their mom asked.

“It was pretty scary," said Annie.

“We got lost in a tomb," said Jack. “But we were saved by an ancient book."

Their mom smiled and shook her head. “My, books are wonderful, aren't they?” she said.

“Yep!" said Jack and Annie.

And they followed her inside.



# Viking Ships at Sunrise

## Prologue

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-yearold sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books. 

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morgan is a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In the Magic Tree House Books #8-12,Jack and Annie solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the letters M L on them.

As Master Librarians, Jack and Annie must go on four missions to save stories from ancient libraries. They have already brought back a scroll from an ancient Roman townand a bamboo book from ancient China. Now, they are about to head out on their third mission ...

## 1：Before Dawn

Jack opened his eyes.

A thin gray light came through his window. His clock read 5 A.M. All was quiet.

Today we're going to ancient Ireland, he thought, back more than a thousand years.

Morgan le Fay had told him that it was a very dangerous time, with Vikings raiding the coasts.

“You awake?” came a whisper.

Annie stood in his doorway. She was dressed and ready to go.

“Yeah, meet you outside,” said Jack as he climbed out of bed.

He pulled on his jeans, T-shirt, and sneakers. He put his secret library card into his backpack with his notebook and pencil. Then he hurried downstairs.

Annie was waiting for him in their yard.

The air was damp and misty.

“Ready?” she asked.

Jack took a deep breath.

“I guess,” he said. He was a little worried about the Vikings.

They walked silently over the dewy grass. Then they ran up their street and into the Frog Creek woods.

Mist clung to the trees as they walked through the dark woods.

“It's hard to see," said Jack.

“Where's the tree house?” asked Annie.

“I have no idea," said Jack.

Just then something fell in front of them.

“Watch out!” shouted Jack. He covered his head.

“The ladder!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes.

The rope ladder from the magic tree house dangled in front of them.

Jack looked up. The tree house was hidden in the mist.

“Come on, let's go," said Annie.

She grabbed the ladder and started up.

Jack followed.

They climbed through the wet air and into the tree house.

“Hello,” said Morgan. “I'm glad to see you."

She was sitting in the corner. At her feet were the scroll they'd brought back from Roman times and the bamboo book from ancient China.

“I'm so glad to see you," said Jack.

“Me too," said Annie.

“It's good that you both came early," said Morgan.

She reached into the folds of her robe and pulled out a piece of paper.

“Here's the ancient story you must find today," she said.

Morgan handed the paper to Jack. On it were the words:

​				erpens Magna

The mysterious writing reminded Jack of the writing from their trip to the Roman town of Pompeii.

“That looks like Latin," he said.

“Very good," said Morgan. “It is Latin."

“But I thought they spoke Latin in ancient Rome,” said Annie. “Aren't we going to Ireland?”

“You are,” said Morgan. “But during the Dark Ages in Europe, educated people wrote in Latin."

“The Dark Ages?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Morgan. “The time after the fall of the Roman Empire."

“Why is it called dark?" said Jack.

“It was a difficult time,” said Morgan. “People had to work very hard just to feed and clothe themselves. There was not a lot of time for playing, learning, or making art and music.”

Morgan pulled a book from her robe.

“Your research,” she said, handing it to Annie. The title read: Ireland Long Ago.

“Remember,” said Morgan. “Your research book will guide you. But in your darkest hour——”

“Only the ancient story can save us," Jack and Annie said together.

“And remember this,” said Morgan. “It must be your darkest hour, when there is no hope left. If you ask for help too soon, it will not come."

“And we have to find the story first," said Annie.

“That is true," said Morgan, “Do you have your secret library cards?”

Jack and Annie nodded.

“Show them to the wisest person you meet,” said Morgan.

“Don't worry,” said Annie. “I think we're ready now."

Annie pointed at the cover of the Ireland book.

“I wish we could go there," she said. She gave Morgan a little wave. “See you soon." 

“Good luck!” said Morgan.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 2：The Steep Climb

Jack opened his eyes.

The light was still gray, but the air was even damper and colder than in Frog Creek.

“Wow, I'm in a long dress,” said Annie. “It's scratchy. Hey, I've got a little purse on my belt. It has my library card in it!” 

Jack looked down at his own clothes.

He was wearing a shirt and trousers, made of heavy wool. He also wore leather slippers. And in place of his backpack was a leather bag.

“Wow,” said Annie, looking out the window. “This really looks like the Dark Ages.”

Jack looked out, too. He couldn't see anything through the mist.

“It's just because the sun's not up yet," he said. "I'd better check the book."

Annie handed the Ireland book to Jack. He opened it and read aloud:

​				The early Middle Ages were once known as the "Dark Ages” because learning and culture nearly 				vanished through out Europe. 
​				Scholars today praise the brave Irish monks who helped keep Western civilization alive.

“What do ‘civilization' and ‘monks' mean?” asked Annie.

“I think civilization is when people have books and art and good manners," said Jack. “Monks are religious people who spend their time praying and reading and helping people.”

“Well. I don't see any civilization or monks out there," said Annie, pointing at the mist.

Jack pulled out his notebook. He wrote:

​				brave monks in Ireland

Then he looked at Annie. “If we find civilization, I think well find the lost story," he said.

“Let's go,” said Annie. She lifted her skirt and climbed out the window.

Jack read more in the [reland book.

​				The monks copied the ancient writing of the Western world.
​				 Before printing was invented all books had to be written and copied by hand.

“Hey, we're on a cliff!” Annie called from outside. “Above the ocean!”

“Be careful!” said Jack.

He stuffed the lreland book and his notebook into his leather bag. Then he climbed out the window.

Annie was peering over the edge. Jack looked, too.

There was a rocky shore twenty feet below. Waves slapped against the rocks. Sea gulls swooped and glided above the sea.

“It doesn't look like there's any civilization down there," said Jack.

“Maybe we should climb those,” said Annie. She pointed to steep steps cut into cliff.

Jack looked up. The cliff also rose above them in the mist.

“We better wait till the sun comes up," he said.

“Let's just go super slow," said Annie. She started up the stone steps.

“Wait, Annie!” said Jack. “They might be slippery.”

“Whoa!” she said, almost falling backward. “I tripped on my darn dress!”

“I told you to wait," Jack said. “It's too dangerous.”

Just then something fell from above. 

“Watch it!” said Jack. He put his hands over his head.

“Hey, it's a rope!” said Annie.

Jack saw a thick rope dangling down the stairs.
“Where'd this come from?" he asked. 

“It's like when Morgan dropped the ladder to us," said Annie. "I bet someone's trying to help us."

“Yeah, but who?” said Jack.

“Let's find out," said Annie. She grabbed the rope. “I'll use it first. Once I'm at the top, you can come after me."

“Okay, but hurry,” he said. “And be very careful.” Jack waited as Annie started climbing up the steps.

Annie held on to the rope as she climbed slowly up the stairs. Soon she vanished over the top of the cliff.

“What's up there?” Jack shouted. But his voice was lost in the sound of the waves. 

He grabbed the rope and started up the steep steps. At the top of the clifr, he pulled himself over the edge.

“Aha!” boomed a deep, jolly voice. “It's another little invader!”



## 3：Brother Patrick

Jack's glasses were wet with mist. He quickly wiped them, then looked up.

A man in a brown robe stood before him. The man had a round red face. He was bald, except for a fringe of hair around his head.

Nearby the rope was tied around a tree. 

“I--I'm not an invader," said Jack.

“He's Jack!” said Annie. She was standing behind the man. “I'm Annie. We're from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania."

“We-we come in peace," stammered Jack.

The man's blue eyes twinkled.

“Oh, do you now?” he said. “I wondered what was going on. I had dropped the rope so I could climb down the steps. But you two grabbed it instead. How in the world did you get on this island?”

Jack stared at the man. He didn't know how to explain the magic tree house.

“In our boat,” Annie said quickly. The man looked puzzled. “Not many boats can come a shore at this dark, early hour."

“Well, we're very good sailors,” said Annie.

Oh, brother, thought Jack. He hoped their sailing skills wouldn't be tested.

“Where exactly are we?” asked Annie. “And who exactly are you?”

“You're on an island off the coast of Ireland,” the man said. “And I am Brother Patrick.”

“Whose brother are you?” said Annie. The monk smiled. “The ‘brother' means I'm a Christian monk.”

“Oh, you're one of the monks who saved civilization!” said Annie.

The man smiled again.

Annie turned to Jack and whispered. “Let's show him our cards. I trust him."

“Okay,” said Jack. He trusted the monk, too.

They both pulled out their secret library cards and showed them to Brother Patrick.

The M's and L's for Master Librarian shined in the gray light.

The monk looked at them and bowed his head.

“Welcome, my friends," he said.

“Thank you,” said Jack and Annie.

“I did not truly think you were invaders," said Brother Patrick. “But on our small island, we are careful of strangers.

"Why?” said Annie. There are terrible stories about Viking raiders," he said. “When we see their serpent ships, we must hide or be taken as slaves.

"Serpent ships?" said Jack. 

“The prows of their ships are often carved in the shape of a serpent's head," said Brother Patrick. “I am afraid it stands for their fierce, cold-blooded ways."

Jack looked at the misty gray sea.

“Do not worry,” said Brother Patrick. They cannot land safely on this island before daylight. They're not as good sailors as some people." He winked at Annie.

“Too bad for them" she said cheerfully.

“But tell me, why have you come here?” asked Brother Patrick.

“Oh," said Jack, “I almost forgot."

He pulled Morgan's paper from his leather bag. He showed the Latin words to the monk.

​				erpens Magna

“This is the title of a story that we have to take back to our friend and teacher, Morganle Fay," said Annie.

“I see . . ." said Brother Patrick, He gave Jack and Annie a mysterious look.

“What's he thinking? Jack wondered.

But the monk changed the subject. “I think you would like to visit our monastery," he said.

“What's that?” said Annie.

“The place where we monks live and work,” said Brother Patrick. “Come."

“But the sun's not up yet,” said Jack. “Won't the others be asleep?”

“Oh, no" said Brother Patrick. "In the summer, we rise long before daylight. We have much to do. You'll see."
The monk led them up a dirt path. Jack hoped their book was at the monastery. He wanted to leave the gloomy island with its threat of Viking invaders as soon as possible.

A low bell started to ring. Jack saw a lonely church steeple against the gray sky ahead.



## 4：Books of Wonder

The monastery had a stone wall all around it.

Brother Patrick took Jack and Annie through the gate. Beyond the gate was a small church with a hanging bell.

There was also a vegetable garden and six stone huts shaped like giant beehives.

We grow all our own food," said Brother Patrick. “Carrots, turnips, spinach, wheat ,and beans."

He led them to the entrance of the first hut. Jack and Annie peeked inside. A monk was pulling flat bread from a low stone oven.

”This is our bakery,” Brother Patrick said.

“It smells good!” said Annie. 

“Come along,” Brother Patrick said. 

He pointed to each hut as they passed. There are our sleeping quarters," he said “And that's where we spin our cloth. In here we cobble our sandals. There we carve our wooden tools.”

In each of the huts, Jack and Annie could see monks. They were busy spinning or cobbling or carving.

Finally, Brother Patrick came to the largest beehive——like hut.

“I have saved the best for last," he said.

“This is where we do our most important work."

He stepped inside.

Jack and Annie followed.

The hut was warm and peaceful, yet very alive. It glowed with the golden light of many candles.

Monks sat at wooden tables. Some were reading. Others played chess. Best of all some were writing and painting in books.

“This is our library," said Brother Patrick. Here we study math, history, and poetry. We play chess. And we make books."

“Jack," said Annie. “I think this is it.”

“What?” said Jack.

“Civilization!” said Annie.

Brother Patrick laughed.

“Yes. this is where civilization hides,” he said. "On top of our lonely island in the sea."

“Oh, man,” said Jack. “I love this place.”

"What kind of books do you make here?" asked Annie.

“Books of wonder,” said Brother Patrick. We record Christian stories as well as the old myths of Ireland.”

"Myths?” said Jack.

“Yes,” said Brother Patrick. “They were gathered from our storytellers——the old women who sing the tales of long ago, when people believed in magic.”

“Wow," said Annie.

“Come," said Brother Patrick, “look at the book of Brother Michael. “He has worked on it his whole life.”

Brother Patrick led Jack and Annie over to an old monk. The monk was painting a blue border around one of the pages in a book.

“Michael, these two Master Librarians from faraway would like to see your work,” said Brother Patrick.

The old monk looked up at Jack and Annie. His wrinkled face broke into a smile. 

“Welcome," said Brother Michael in a thin, shaky voice.

“Hi," said Annie.

Brother Michael showed them the cover of his book. It was decorated with gleaming red and blue jewels.

Then he turned the pages. Each was covered with fancy writing and delicate paintings in green, gold, and blue.

“I wish I could paint like that,” said Annie.

“It's beautiful,” whispered Jack. 

“Thank you," said Brother Michael.

“How do you make a book like this?” asked Annie.

“I write on sheepskin and use goose quill pens,” said Brother Michael. “My paints are made of earth and plants."

“Wow," said Annie.

“Show Michael what you are seeking,” Brother Patrick said.

“Oh, right!” said Jack. He pulled out the paper Morgan had given them. He showed the Latin writing to the old monk.

Brother Michael nodded.

“Yes,” he said with a smile. “I know that one quite well.”

Brother Michael turned to the page he had been painting with a blue border. He pointed to the writing at the top of the page.

“Oh, man,” whispered Jack. The words were:
				erpens Magna



## 5：Warships on the Waves

“We found our story!" said Jack.

“Yay!” said Annie.

“Indeed,” said Brother Patrick. “But alas, Brother Michael has not yet completed his work. You will have to return for it."

“Oh, shoot,” said Annie.

Jack was disappointed, too.

“I don't know if we'll be able to come back," he said.

“I don't know if we can even leave without the story," said Annie.

Brother Patrick looked puzzled.

The two kids looked at each other, then back at Brother Patrick. It was too hard to explain about the tree house and how the magic worked.

Jack shrugged.

“We'll just have to try," he said.

Outside, the church bell began ringing.

“It is time now for our sunrise prayers, said Brother Patrick. “Will you join us?”

“Thanks, but we better try to go home now," said Jack

Brother Patrick nodded and led them into the garden. When he opened the gate, they stopped.

The horizon glowed pink and purple. The sun had started to rise.

No one spoke as the great, fiery ball rose slowly over the ocean.

Finally, Brother Patrick broke the silence. “Shine, O light of the sun," he said softly, “on this day filled with wonder.”

“That's beautiful,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He agreed.

Brother Patrick turned to them. “It is such sights as this that inspire our book-making,” he said. “Now go, and may God be with you on your voyage home."

“Thanks," said Jack and Annie.

“Do you need me to guide you to your boat?" he asked.

“I don't think so," said Jack.

“Follow the path to the top of the clifr," said Brother Patrick. “Then use my rope to help you down the steps.”

“Okay,” said Annie. “Bye!” And she went through the gate.

Jack wanted to go home, but he hated leaving the monastery. It was filled with people doing his favorite things: reading and learning.

“I really like it here," he said to Brother Patrick.

“I'm glad. But you must go now, while the weather is with you," said the monk. “Everything can change in an instant."

Then Brother Patrick turned and went into the church.

Jack hurried out the gate. Before he went further, he stopped and pulled out his notebook.

He quickly made two lists:

 To make a book       To make paint
	Sheepskin					earth
	goose quill					plants
	Paints			

“Come on!” Annie called from the top of the steps.

“Coming,” Jack called.

He put away his notebook and ran along the dirt path to the edge of the cliff.

Overhead. flocks of gulls circled in the purple sky. Their cries sounded like screams.

“What's wrong with them?” Jack said.

“Maybe they always do this at sunrise," said Annie. “Let me go first."

Clutching the rope, she started down the steps.

Jack grabbed the rope and started down. The birds' cries went on. They worried him. They sounded like warnings.

Jack reached the rocky ledge and let go of the rope.

“Let's go!” Annie called from the tree house.

Jack looked at the horizon one last time.

His heart nearly stopped. A ship was outlined against the sky! Behind it, he saw two smaller ships.

As the ships came into view, their bright sails were filled with wind and their serpent prows blazed in the new sunlight.

“Oh, no.” Jack whispered. “Vikings!”



## 6：The Vikings Are Coming!

“Annie!” Jack cried. “Vikings!” 

Annie looked out the tree house window. “Vikings?”

“They're headed straight for the island!” said Jack.

He turned back to the stone steps.

“Where are you going?" cried Annie.

“To warn the monks!” Jack said.

“I’ll come, too!” cried Annie. She scrambled out of the tree house.

“Hurry!” said Jack.

Jack didn't even use the rope. He pulled himself up the steep steps with his hands.

As Jack and Annie climbed up the face of the cliff, clouds began to cover the sun. When they reached the top, a fog had almost hidden the serpent ships.

“Run!” cried Annie. The fog blanketed the whole island. Jack and Annie could barely see the path to the monastery.
When they arrived at the gate, the misty white world was silent.

“Vikings!” Jack cried. “Vikings!”

The monks are still in church!” said Annie. She yanked the bell rope.

Dong! Dong!

Jack and Annie watched as Brother Patrick and the other monks ran out of the church.

“The Vikings are coming!” Jack shouted.

Brother Patrick's rosy face turned white.

“Make haste!” he said to the other monks. "Gather the books and hide."

The monks ran into the library. Brother Patrick turned to Jack and Annie.

“We have a secret hiding place, a cave on the other side of the island," he said, “You can come with us. But I am not certain you will be safe."

“Don't worry,” said Jack. “We're going to try to go home."

“Do not use the steps,” Brother Patrick said. “The Vikings will climb them.”

“Then how do we get down?” said Jack.

“Go that way,” said Brother Patrick, pointing. “At the cliff's edge are two large rocks. A path between those rocks will take you down to the shore. Then you can walk around to your boat."

“Thanks!” said Annie.

“Be careful!” said Brother Patrick. He hurried inside the library.

“Wait!” came a thin voice as Jack and Annie turned to run.

It was Brother Michael. He hobbled over to them, holding out his book of Irish tales.

“Take it," he said.

“Are you sure?” Jack asked. He knew it was Brother Michael's life's work.

“Please," said Brother Michael. “It is better that the world should have some of it than none at all. Just in case .. ."

“We'll take good care of it,” said Jack. He gently placed the jeweled book in his leather bag.

“Good luck! said Annie. Annie and Jack waved good-bye to the old man. Then they raced to the rocks that Brother Patrick had told them about.



## 7：Fogbound

At the rocks, the sea gulls still screeched. Jack could barely see the steep path leading down into the fog.

“Go slowly,” Jack whispered to Annie as they started down.

“Whoops!” said Annie. She slipped and fell forward, bumping into Jack. “My foot got caught in my stupid dress—”

“Shh!” said Jack.

He held on to Annie. They listened as pebbles and rocks rolled down the cliff.

Jack took a deep breath.

“We've got to watch out for Vikings, too," he whispered.

They started down the steep path again. They went one step at a time. The sound of the waves against the rocks grew louder.

Finally, they stepped down onto a flat strip of pebbles.

“Where are we?" whispered Annie.

“I don't know," said Jack.

“Oh, look!” said Annie. She pointed to the shoreline.

Through the fog rose the serpent prows of the Viking ships!

Jack and Annie crept closer to the ships. Their sails were down. Each ship had been tied to a tall jagged rock. They seemed deserted as they bobbed in the shallow waves.

Jack really wanted to check out the ships. But he was afraid of wasting time.

“We'd better find the tree house," he said to Annie.

They crept away from the three Viking ships.

Suddenly, they both froze.

Through the mist, they saw a group of Viking warriors. The Vikings were looking at the top of the cliff.

Their long yellow hair hung down from beneath their iron helmets. They carried round wooden shields and swords and axes. 

“It looks like they're planning to climb the cliff,” whispered Annie.

“We need to hide until they go,” whispered Jack. "Then we can look for the tree house.”

“Let's hide in a ship!" said Annie.

“Good idea,” said Jack.

They crept back to where the ships were tied.

Jack was happy to see that the sides of the smallest ship were very low, They would easily be able to climb over them.

“You go first," said Annie.

Jack waded through the shallow water. It was cold!

He reached the ship and grabbed one side.He pushed himself up and onto the ship's deck.

The ship jerked forward. Jack looked at the shore. It was now thirty feet away. The ship's anchoring rope was pulled tight. The serpent prow bobbed up and down with the waves.

The fog and the movement of the ship made Jack feel as if he was in a dream. For a moment, he forgot to be scared of the Vikings.

“This is so cool,” he called. “Come on Annie!”

Annie started to wade out to the ship.

Suddenly, she disappeared.

“Annie?” called Jack.

Her head popped out of the water. She splashed with her arms.

“It—it's deep!” she gasped. “My dress too heavy!”

“Use the rope!” called Jack. “Like when we climbed the stairs!”

Annie grabbed the rope that stretched from ship to shore. It held her weight as she began inching along it.

“Hold on tight!” cried Jack.

”I—am!” gasped Annie.

She kept going, hand over hand, along the rope, toward the ship.

When Annie got close to the ship, Jack reached out to help her. As he pulled her in, the side of the ship dipped down.

Then the rope went slack, and the Viking ship slid out to sea.





## 8：Lost at Sea

Annie fell to the  deck of the ship.

Jack pulled the rope out of the water. The end of it was still tied in a loop.

“What happened?” asked Annie.

“We’re heading out to sea,” said Jack . “I guess all the pulling lifted the rope off the rock.”

Annie sat up and looked  at the misty whiteness.

“I can’t see the island,” she said.

“I can’t see anything,” said Jack.

Annie looked at Jack.

“Do you think this is our darkest hour?” she asked.

“I don't know,” said Jack. “Maybe the book will help.”

He pulled out their research book. He found a picture of a Viking ship. He read the caption aloud:

​				Viking warships were the best ships of their times.
​				When there was no wind, the crew would take down the sails and row with oars. 
​				The smallest ships had four rowers, and the largest had as many as thirty-two. 
​				Rowers sat on boxes that stored their belongings.

“Great,” said Annie, jumping up. “This isn’t our darkest hour!”

“Why do you say that?" asked Jack.

“There's still hope,” said Annie. “We can row to the other side of the island and find the tree house.”

“Are you nuts?” said Jack.

“Please, Jack,” said Annie. “Can we just try?”

She grabbed one of the oars. She could barely lift it.

“Forget it, Annie,” said Jack. “It takes four big Viking guys to row this thing. You're too little. I’m too little."

“Come on, Jack. Just try,” said Annie. “You get an oar, too. Well sit on boxes across from each other,"

“Oh, brother,” said Jack.

Annie dragged her long oar over to a storage box.

“I'm not doing this alone," she said.

Jack groaned. Then he dragged an oar to the box across from Annie.

“Cool!” said Annie. She peered into a storage box. “Look, one for each of us!”

She lifted out two small Viking helmets. 

“Maybe these were made for Viking kids who sometimes ride in this ship,” said Annie.

“Maybe,” said Jack.

He hadn't thought of Vikings as real people before—people with families and little kids.

Annie pulled off her scarf and put a helmeton her head.

“Now I feel like a Viking, too," she said. "I bet it will help me row."

She handed Jack a helmet. He put it on. It made him feel a little different.

“I don't know about this," he said. The helmet wasn't as heavy as the one he had worn in the time of castles. But it was still pretty heavy.

“Well, I'm braver with mine on,” said Annie.

Jack smiled. He didn't know how Annie could be braver than she already was.

“Ready to row?" she asked.

“Yup,” said Jack. He was feeling braver himself.

The wind picked up as Jack lifted his heavy oar over the side of the ship.

He lowered it into the water. But the current was so strong that the oar was ripped from his hands.

Jack fell over backward as his oar slipped into the sea.

“I lost my oar!" Annie yelled.

Jack looked up as rain started to fall. The sky was black. A gush of seawater poured over the side of the ship!

“Brrr!" said Annie as she tried to stand.

The black sky shook with thunder and flashed with lightning.

Jack crawled to the side of the ship and pulled himself up.

Another huge wave was coming right toward them!

"It's our darkest hour now!” cried Annie. “Get Brother Michael's book!”

Jack reached into his leather bag. He pulled out the jeweled book and held it up.

“Save us, story!” he cried.

He looked at the sea again. What he saw made him scream.

Rising from the on coming wave was a giant sea serpent!



## 9：Sea Monster!

The serpent's head rose higher and higher above the water.

Jack couldn't move.

“He's beautiful!” said Annie. 

“Beautiful?” cried Jack.

The serpent's neck was as tall as a two-story building. Its green scales were covered with sea slime.

“Go away!” shouted Jack.

“No—stay! Help us!” shouted Annie.

The great serpent glided closer to the ship.

“Jack ducked.

“Come on!” said Annie. “You can do it! Get us to shore before the ship sinks!”

Jack closed his eyes. He felt the ship jerk, then move forward.

He looked up. They were gliding over the giant waves.

Jack turned. The great serpent was pressing its long neck a gainst the back of the ship, pushing it toward the shore.

As the serpent pushed them, the wind grew calmer. The clouds lifted and the water glittered with sunlight.

The rocky shore grew closer. Jack could see the tree house on the ledge above it.

“Hurry!" Annie called to the serpent monster.

The great serpent gave the ship one last push. The ship swooshed onto a sand bar near the shore.

Jack put the jeweled book carefully back into his bag. Then he and Annie climbed out of the ship onto the wet sand. They looked back at the sea.

The great serpent was rearing its long neck into the air. Its scales glittered pink and green in the sunlight.

“Bye!” shouted Annie. “Thanks a lot!”

The monster seemed to nod at her. Then he dove into the sea and was gone.

Jack and Annie headed toward the rocks. All of a sudden, Annie gasped.

“Uh-oh," she said, pointing to the top of the cliff.

Two Vikings were staring down at them! 

“To the tree house!" cried Jack.

The Vikings shouted and started down the steep stairs.

Jack and Annie began scrambling up the rocks.

They reached the tree house and climbed inside.

Jack grabbed the Pennsylvania book.

Annie stuck her head out the window.

“Go home! Stop causing trouble!” she yelled to the Vikings, who were almost to the ledge.

Jack pointed at the picture of the Frog Creek woods.

“IWISHWECOULDGOTHERE!” Jack shouted.

Just as the Vikings reached the ledge, the wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：Sunrise

“Boy, I'm glad to be back in my jeans,” said Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. He still felt damp. But he was glad to be wearing his jeans again, too.

“Welcome home,” said Morgan. She was standing in the shadows. “Are you all right?”

“Of course!" piped Annie.

“And we brought back the lost book,” said Jack.

He reached in his backpack and took out the jeweled book of Brother Michael. He handed it to Morgan.

The enchantress sighed. She ran her hand over the sparkling cover.

“A great work of art," she said.

Morgan then put the book next to the scroll from Roman times and the bamboo book from ancient China.

“I'm afraid the story you wanted is not all there," said Jack, “Brother Michael didn't get the chance to finish it."

Morgan nodded.

“I know,” she said. “Sadly, we have only bits and pieces of many wonderful old stories.”

“What's the story about?" asked Annie.“It's an ancient Irish tale about a great serpent named Sarph,” said Morgan.

“He saved us by pushing our ship over the stormy waves!” Annie said.

“Sarph was a huge, ugly monster,” said Jack. 

Morgan smiled.

“Sometimes monsters can be heroes," she said.

“What about Vikings?” asked Jack.

“Oh. most definitely, Vikings could be heroes, too,” she said. “In fact, once the Vikings settled down, they became more than just a warrior people. They actually added a lot to civilization."

“We found civilization on our trip," said Annie. 

“Yeah,” said Jack, “in the library of the monastery.”

Morgan smiled again.

“Their library was a light in the Dark Ages, wasn't it?" she said.

Jack nodded. He thought of Brother Michael and the other monks making their beautiful books by candle light.
“Thank you also for your great courage,” Morgan said. “You are both heroes, too."

Jack smiled shyly.

“Go home now and rest," said Morgan.

“Bye,” Jack and Annie said together.

They started down the tree house ladder.

The sky was turning pink and gold.

When they reached the ground, Morgan called out to them, “Come back in two weeks. I need you to find one more lost book.”

“Where is it?” said Jack.

“Ancient Greece,” said Morgan.“ A place with the highest civilization——and the first Olympic games."

"Oh, wow!” said Annie.

Jack was thrilled. He had always wanted to go to ancient Greece.

Jack and Annie took off through the woods.

The sun was rising when they got to their front porch.

Annie opened the front door She stuck her head inside and listened.

“Everything's quiet,” she whispered. “I think Mom and Dad are still sleeping.”

She moved quietly inside.

Jack turned back to watch the red sun rise through a clear blue sky.

He thought about how it was the same sun that had risen in Ireland——over a thousand years ago.

“Shine, O light of the sun,” Jack whispered, “on this day filled with wonder.”

Then he slipped inside his quiet house.

# Hour of the Olympics

## Prologae

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods.

Eight-year-old Jack and his seven-year-old sister, Annie, climbed into the tree house. They found that it was filled with books.

Jack and Annie soon discovered that the tree house was magic. It could take them to the places in the books. All they had to do was to point to a picture and wish to go there.

Along the way, they discovered that the tree house belongs to Morgan le Fay. Morganis a magical librarian from the time of King Arthur. She travels through time and space, gathering books.

In the Magic Tree House Books #8-12, Jack and Annie solved four ancient riddles and became Master Librarians. To help them in their future tasks, Morgan gave Jack and Annie secret library cards with the lettersM L on them.

Jack and Annie's first four missions are to save stories from ancient libraries. This is their fourth mission..



## 1：dust One More

“You awake?” Annie's voice came out of the dark.

“Yep,” said Jack from his bed.

“Get up,” said Annie. “We have to get to the tree house before sunrise.”

“I'm ready,” said Jack. He threw back his covers and jumped out of bed. He was wearing his jeans and T-shirt.

“You slept in your clothes?” asked Annie.

“I didn't want to waste any time,” said Jack. He pulled on his backpack.

Annie laughed.

“You must really be excited about going to ancient Greece," she said.

“Yep,” said Jack.

“Do you have your secret library card? asked Annie.

“Yeah, do you?” said Jack.

“Sure. Put it in your backpack,” she said. She handed her card to him. “I’ll carry the flashlight.”

“All set,” said Jack.

They tiptoed downstairs and out the door.

Outside the air was fresh and cool.

“There's no moon,” said Annie. “Just stars.”

She turned on her flashlight. 

“Ta-da!” she said. “Let's go."

They followed the beam of light across their yard and up the street.

Jack was thrilled to be going to ancient Greece. But something worried him.

“What do you think will happen after we go to Greece?” he asked Annie. “Is this our last mission ever?”

“Oh, I hope not,” said Annie. “What do you think?”

“I don't know. Let's ask Morgan,” said Jack.

“Hurry!” said Annie.

They started running. The flashlight beam flew in front of them, lighting the way.

They slowed to a walk when they got to the Frog Creek woods. The thick woods were pitch-black.

Annie shined the flashlight upward as they walked between the trees. Finally, they found the magic tree house.

“We're here!” Annie called.

“Go on up,” said Jack.

Annie grabbed the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed.

Annie shined the flashlight around the tree house.

Morgan le Fay was sitting at the window. She covered her eyes when the light hit her face.

“Turn off the light, please, Annie,” she said softly.

Annie turned it off.

“Welcome,” Morgan said in the dark. “Are you ready for your next mission?”

“Yes!” said Annie. Then her voice got quiet. “This isn't our last one ever, is it?”

“Ask me that question after this mission,” said Morgan.

“We want to go on more," said Jack.

“You're very brave to say that,” said Morgan. “You've had three very hard journeys as Master Librarians.

“Oh, they weren't so hard,” said Jack.

“You risked your life to save the lost story of Hercules,” said Morgan.

“It was nothing,” said Annie.

“And the Chinese story of the silk weaver,” said Morgan. “And the Irish story of the serpent monster Sarph. Thank you.”

“You're welcome,” said Jack and Annie.

“Now," said Morgan, “for the last story...

Jack heard a rustling sound. 

“Here is the title,” Morgan said. “You can shine your light on it, Annie.”

Annie turned the flashlight back on.She shined it on the paper.

​			TITAEOE

“Wow, is that Greek?” asked Jack.

“It certainly is,” said Morgan.

She reached into her robe again and pulled out a book.

“For your research,” she said.

Jack took the book from her. Annie shined her flashlight on the cover. They read the title: A Day in Ancient Greece.

“Now what must you always remember?” asked Morgan.

“Our research book will guide us,” said Jack.

“But in our darkest hour, only the lost story can save us,” said Annie.

Morgan nodded. “And you must show your secret library cards to the wisest person you meet,” she said.

“Don't worry We will. Bye!” said Annie.

Jack shivered with excitement as he pointed at the book's cover.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

“And I wish we could go on lots of other missions!” Annie added.

The wind began to blow.

The tree house started to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was silent.

Absolutely silent.



## 2：Any Girls Here?

Jack opened his eyes. Warm sunshine streamed into the tree house.

“We sure don't need the flashlight here,” he said.

“Look, Morgan gave us clothes like the ones we wore in Pompeii," said Annie. 

Jack looked down.

His clothes were similar to the ones he'd worn in the Roman town of Pompeii: a tunic and sandals. He also had a leather bag in place of his backpack again.

Annie looked out the window.

“And we landed in an olive tree——just like Pompeii!” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. He caught his breath.

“Are we in the wrong place?” he asked.

“I don't know,” said Annie. “Look past the trees. Doesn't it look like a big fair?”

Jack looked. Annie was right. Past the olive grove was a field filled with white tents. Beyond the field were red-brick buildings with columns and huge crowds of people.

“What's going on?” Jack asked.

He pulled the research book out of his leather bag. He found a picture of the scene outside. Below the picture were these words:

​				The Olympic Games began in ancient Greece over 2,500 years ago.
​				Every four years, more than 40,000 people traveled to Olympia, the town where the festival of 				athletic games took place.

“Oh, man,” Jack whispered. “We're at the ancient Olympics!”

“Cool,” said Annie.

Jack wrote in his notebook:

​			Olympia-
​			first Olympics take place

“Come on, let's go watch!” Annie said. She started down the rope ladder.

Jack threw his notebook and the research book into his leather bag.

“Don't forget we have to get Morgan's story, too," he said as he followed Annie.

Annie waited as Jack stepped to the ground. Then they walked through the olive grove to where the tents were.

Jack heard pipe music and smelled food roasting over fires. Groups of men talked excitedly to one another.

“That's funny,” said Annie. “I don't see any girls here.”

“Oh, sure, there're girls,” said Jack.

“Where?” said Annie. “Show me.”

Jack looked around. But he only saw men and boys——no women or girls at all.

Then he saw an outdoor theater. A woman was standing on the stage. She had yellow hair and a purple tunic.

“There,” said Jack, pointing.

“What's she doing?” asked Annie.			

A soldier was on the stage with her. He wore a long cape. A helmet with a red crest hid his face.

The woman and the soldier were waving their arms and talking loudly to each other.

“I think they're doing a play,” said Jack. “I’ll look.”

He pulled out the Greek book and found a picture of the theater.

“Listen,” he said. He read aloud:

​				The Greeks were the first to write plays.
​				Many English words for the theater come from Greek words, such as drama, scenery, and chorus. 
​				Many Greek plays are still performed today.

“Hey, Jack,” said Annie. “You're wrong.” 

When Jack looked up, he saw the woman had pulled off her wig. It was a boy dressed up as a woman!

“See, even she' a boy, said Annie. “That's weird.”

“Hmm,” said Jack. He went on reading:

​				A few actors would play many different parts in the same play. 
​				Women were not allowed to act, so men played the female roles, too.

“That's not fair,” said Annie. “What if a woman wanted to be in a play?”

“Don't worry about it,” said Jack. He putthe book away. “Let's just take a peek at the Olympics, then find our story.”

He nudged Annie to move along.

Just then he heard a voice. 

“Wait!”

They turned around. A man with a short white beard was walking toward them.

“Hello.” said the man. He was looking right at Annie. “Who are you?”

“Who are you?” Annie asked boldly.



## 3：The Secret Poet

The bearded man smiled at Annie.

“My name is Plato," he said.

“Plato?” said Jack. That name sounded familiar.

“You may have heard of me,” the man said.“ I am a philosopher.

”What's that mean?” said Annie.

“A lover of wisdom,” said Plato.

“Wow,” said Annie.

Plato smiled at her.

“It's odd to see a girl walking so bravely through Olympia,” he said. “You must be from far away.”

“We're Jack and Annie,” said Annie. “And we come from Frog Creek, Pennsylvania. It's very far away.”

Plato looked puzzled.

Annie turned to Jack.

“I think we should show him our cards,” she said in a low voice. “He's a lover of wisdom,” 

Jack nodded. He reached into his bag and took out the secret library cards. He showed them to Plato.

The letters M and L that stood for Master Librarian glittered on the cards.

“Amazing!” said Plato. “I've never met such young Master Librarians. Why have you come to Olympia?”

Jack pulled out the piece of paper with the title of the story.

“We're looking for this story," he said.

​				TTITAZOE

“Oh, yes,” said Plato softly. “This was written by a brilliant poet——a friend of mine. in fact.”

“Do you know where the poet lives?” asked Jack.

“Very near here,” said Plato. 

“Will you take us there?” asked Annie.

“Yes, but I must warn you——never tell anyone who the poet is,” said Plato.“Its a secret.”

“We won't,” whispered Annie.

Plato led them away from the outdoor theater.

They started down a dirt road. It was crowded with people heading to the games.

Plato stopped at the door of a sand-colored house with a brick roof.

He opened the door and led Jack and Annie into an empty courtyard.

“Wait here,” he said. He disappeared through a doorway.

Jack and Annie looked around.

Rooms opened onto the sunny courtyard. Everything was quiet.

“The people who live here must have gone to the games,’ said Annie.

“I bet you're right,” said Jack. 

He pulled out the Greek book and found a picture of a house. He read aloud:

​				Men and women lived in separate parts of a Greek house. 
​				Women spent most of their time spinning and weaving and taking care of the kitchen.
​				Boys were sent away to school when they were seven. 
​				Girls were not allowed to go to school.

“Girls can't go to school?” said Annie. “How do they learn to read and write?”

At that moment Plato returned. With him was a young woman dressed in a long tunic with a colored border. She was holding a scroll.

Annie smiled a big smile.

“Finally,” she said. “Another girl.”

“Jack and Annie, meet our secret poet,” said Plato.



## 4：Not Fair!

The young woman smiled at Jack and Annie.

“How did you learn to read and write?” Annie asked.

“I taught myself,” the woman answered.

“She wrote a poem and brought it to me,” said Plato, “because I have written and told people that I think Greek girls should go to school and learn things.”

“Is that the poem?” said Jack. He pointed to the poet's scroll.

“Yes,” said the young woman.

“It's a wonderful story,” said Plato. “But she will get in trouble if it is read in our land. You must take it back to your faraway home, where it will be safe.”

The poet handed Jack her scroll. He put it into his backpack.

“Tell us your name,” said Annie. “So we can tell people who wrote the story.”

The young woman shook her head.

“I cannot,” she said. When she saw Annie's sad face, she added, “You can tell people it was written by Anonymous.”

“That's your name?” asked Annie.

“No,anonymous means that no one knows who wrote it," said Plato.

“But that's not true!” said Annie.

“I'm afraid the risk is too great,” said Plato.

Annie looked back at the woman.

“I'm sorry,” said Annie. “It's not fair——not at all.”

The poet smiled at her. “I am happy that you will take my story to your country,” she said. “Perhaps someday women everywhere will write books just like men.

“They will,” said Jack. “I promise.” 

The young woman looked at him, puzzled

“It's true!” said Annie.

“Thank you, Annie,” the young woman said. “And thank you, Jack. She bowed, then hurried out of the courtyard.

“Wait!” said Annie.

She started to go after the poet, but Plato stopped her.

“Come along,” he said. “The games will start soon.”

Plato then led Jack and Annie out of the Greek house back onto the dirt road.

“Girls can't write stories,” grumbled Annie. “They can't go to school. They can't be in plays. I've had enough of ancient Greece. Let's get out of here.”

“Wait,” said Jack. “What about the Olympics?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Annie. Her eyes got brighter. “I almost forgot.”

“Well,” said Plato slowly. “I would like to take you both to the games. I have special seats in the viewing box. However...” Helooked at Annie.

“Don't tell me,” she said. “Girls can't go to the Olympics either.”

Plato shook his head.

“A girl will get in terrible trouble if she goes to the games," he said.

Annie sighed. “It's really, really not fair,” she said.

“I'm sorry,” said Plato. “My country is a democracy. We believe in freedom for our citizens. But I'm afraid right now that only means men.

“Annie's right. It's not fair,” said Jack. “I think we should go home now.”

“No, Jack. You go to the Olympics,” said Annie. “At least you can tell me about it. Take notes.”

“What about you?” Jack said.

“I'll go back to that play at the outdoor theater,” Annie said. “Meet me there when you're done.”

Jack didn't want to leave Annie alone. But he also didn't want to miss the Olympics.

“Go! Have fun!” Annie said. She began walking away. “I’ll see you later! Bye, Plato!“

“Bye, Annie,” said Plato.

Annie turned back again and waved.

“I'll tell you all about it! Jack called.

“This way,” said Plato.

He and Jack turned and joined the crowd heading toward the Olympic grounds.



## 5：Hi, Zeus

“This is the very first day of the games,” Plato told Jack, “the day of the chariot races.“

“Oh, wow,” whispered Jack.

He couldn't believe he was going to see a chariot race. The modern Olympic Games didn't have chariot races.

They walked toward the race track. Plato pointed to a large building near the road.

“That is the gymnasium,” he said. “It is where our athletes train. They practice running and throwing the javelin and discus.

“We have a gymnasium at our school in Frog Creek,” said Jack. “We call it a gym.”

“People all over the world copy us Greeks,” Plato said.

“Wait." said Jack. “I have to take notes for Annie.”

He pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​				Ancient Greeks invented Gyms

“Okay, we can go,” said Jack. He tucked his notebook under his arm.

As they moved along, Plato pointed to a beautiful tree nearby.

“The olive tree is our sacred tree,” he said. “The winners of the games will wear crowns made from its branches.”

“Oh, wow," said Jack. And he wrote:

​				Olive tree is sacred

Next they passed a beautiful statue of a winged lady.

“Who's that?” said Jack.

“She's Nike, the goddess of victory,” said Plato.

Jack quickly wrote:

​				Nike is goddess of victory

“Nike is important to the games,” said Plato. “But the most important Olympic god is in there.”

He took Jack to a brick building with huge columns. They stepped through the door. It was a temple. Jack gasped.

 In front of them loomed the biggest statue he had ever seen.

The statue was at least two stories high. It was a bearded man sitting on a throne.

“This is the temple of Zeus. And that is a statue of Zeus himself,” said Plato. “The Olympic Games are played in his honor. He is the chief god of the Greek gods and goddesses.

“Oh, man, whispered Jack.

“Yesterday all the athletes came here,” said Plato. “They swore to Zeus that they had trained for ten months. And they promised to obey the rules of the games.”

The statue of the mighty Greek god stared down at Jack.

Jack felt very small. “Hi, Zeus,” he said. His voice was small too.

Suddenly, trumpet sounds came from outside.
“The hour has come,” said Plato. “We must hurry. The Olympic parade begins!”



## 6：Mystery Man

Plato and Jack hurried past the crowds standing at the sides of the race track. Everyonewas shouting and cheering.

“I have seats next to the judges,” said Plato. He pointed to a tall stand with rows of benches.

Plato led Jack through the crowd and up the steps to their seats.

“Wow, thanks,” said Jack.

He had a great view.

The Olympic parade had already started. Musicians playing pipes were at the front. Behind them marched the Olympic athletes——the best in all of Greece.

Jack sighed as he watched the parade going around the track. Annie would really love this, he thought.

“The athletes in front are the runners,” said Plato. “Foot races are the oldest event of the Olympics.”

Jack pulled out his notebook and wrote:

​				oldest cvent is foot races

“Behind the runners are the boxers,” said Plato. “They’re wearing special gloves and bronze helmets.”

Jack wrote:

​			boxers wear gloves and helmets

“Behind them are the wrestlers,” said Plato.

And Jack wrote:

​			wrestlers

When Jack looked up again, he saw a soldier staring up at him from the sidelines.

The soldier was dressed like the actor from the outdoor theater. He had on a long cape and a red-crested helmet that covered most of his face.

But something was strange. This soldier was short——really short.

“Here come the discus and javelin throwers.” said Plato. “and then the men in armor.” 

“What do they do?” asked Jack。

“They race wearing full armor,” said Plato.

Jack smiled to himself. He knew Annie would think that was funny.

He wrote in his notebook:

​			Some runners race in armor

Jack finished writing.

He looked back at the short soldier.

“In a moment. the chariot races will begin” said Plato. “Winning a chariot race is the greatest honor of the games.”

Jack just nodded. He was still studying the short soldier who seemed to be looking back at him.

Suddenly, a small hand came out from the soldier's cape. The hand gave a little wave.

Jack gasped. It was Annie's hand waving!

The short soldier was Annie.



## 7：Go! Go! Go!

Jack stared in horror at Annie. She must have borrowed a costume from the theater!

He remembered Plato's words: A girl will get in terrible trouble if she tries to attend the Olympic Games.

Jack shook his head at her and pointed his finger, as if to say, Get out of here!

But Annie just waved at him again.

Jack kept shaking his head at Annie. He even shook his fist.

Annie turned back to watch the race.

“It's not a joke!” Jack shouted.

Plato turned and looked at him.

“Of course not,” said Plato. “We take the games very seriously.”

Jack felt his face grow hot. He glared at Annie's back.

Just then the trumpet sounded.

“The chariots are taking their places,” said Plato.

Jack saw the dozens of chariots lined up on the race track. Each chariot was pulled by four horses.

Jack glanced back at Annie. She was looking up at him, pointing at the chariots.

The trumpet sounded again.

The horses took off!

The crowd went wild. They were cheering and screaming and stamping their feet.

Clouds of dust rose up as the chariot sraced around the track.

Annie turned back to watch the race. She began jumping up and down.

“Go! Go! Go!” she shouted.

A few people began staring at the strange small soldier with the high-pitched voice.

Jack couldn't take it anymore. He had to get Annie away before it was too late!

He shoved his notebook into his pack.

“I have to go!” he shouted to Plato.

The philosopher looked surprised.

Jack was afraid to tell him that Annie had broken the rules.

“I had a great time. But I have to go home now,” said Jack. “Thanks for everything!”

”Have a safe journey,” said Plato.

Jack waved and started down the steps.

As he climbed down, he saw Annie pull off her helmet.

Her pigtails flew up and down as she jumped and shouted, “Go! Go! Go!”

Her soldier's cape fell off.

Now lots of people were staring at her. Someone shouted for the guards.

Annie was too busy cheering to notice anything.

Jack moved as quickly as he could.

But two big guards got to Annie first.



## 8：Save Annie!

The guards tried to pull Annie away from the chariot race.

Annie looked surprised. Then she looked angry.

“Let go of me!” she shouted.

Jack rushed down the steps of the viewing stand.

The guards were having a hard time pulling Annie through all the people.

“Leave her alone!” Jack yelled.

His voice was lost in the noise of the race.

He pushed his way through the crowd.

“Leave her alone!” he kept shouting. ”Leave her alone!”

Finally, Jack reached Annie and the guards. He tried to grab her, but a guard blocked his way.

“Let her go!“ yelled Jack. “I promise I‘ll take her home!”

More guards arrived. The crowd began to shout, “Arrest her! Arrest her!”

The guards kept pulling Annie away.

“Jack! The story!” cried Annie.

Of course! thought Jack. The poet's story!

This is definitely our darkest hour!

He reached into his bag and pulled out the poet's scroll.

“Save Annie!” he shouted.

But Jack's voice was again lost in the roar of the race as the four-horse chariots barreled through the dust.

Jack looked around wildly for someone——or something——to help them.

Then suddenly the crowd fell silent.

All heads turned to watch as a huge white horse galloped out of the dust.

The crowd murmured with excitement and wonder.

The white horse was the most beautiful animal Jack had ever seen.

He was pulling an empty chariot.

And he was galloping straight toward Jack.

He held the story up to the sky.



## 9：Fly Away Hone

The white horse stopped at the low wall by the edge of the track.

“He's come for us!” cried Annie. 

The guards stared in awe at the horse.

Annie broke free and dashed over to Jack. He grabbed her hand and they ran to the horse.

The guards shouted and started after them。

But they were too late. Jack and Annie had already climbed over the wall and into the waiting chariot.

“Go! Go! Go!” Annie cried to the huge white horse.

The horse reared and pawed the air.

The crowd stepped back from the wall.

The guards froze.

Jack looked up to where Plato was now standing. Plato smiled and waved at him.

Then the white horse leaped forward, pulling the chariot behind him.

Jack couldn't even wave back at Plato. All he could do was hold on tight as the horse galloped beside the Olympic racers.

Jack bounced up and down. Dust and sand got in his eyes. He squeezed them shut and crouched down in the chariot.

He didn't know where they were going. But it didn't matter. The white horse was in charge.

Jack heard the thundering noise of the racing horses and chariots. He heard the screaming crowd.

He felt sand blowing in his face and the hard bumping and rattling of the chariot.

Suddenly, he was thrown backward. He heard a swoosh of wind, then...

Silence.

“Oh, wow!” cried Annie.

Jack opened his eyes. All he saw was bluesky. He pushed his glasses into place and looked around.

“Help!” he cried.

The white horse had grown giant feathery wings and was pulling their chariot into the sky.

Jack gripped the railing of the chariot and held on for his life.

“To the tree house!” shouted Annie.

Below, the Olympic crowd watched in stunned silence.

The winged horse left the games behind and flew over the temple of Zeus, over the statue of Nike, over the sacred olive tree and the gymnasium.

On they went: over the poet's house, the Greek theater, and the field of white tents. 

Finally, the winged horse coasted to the ground near the olive grove.

The wheels of the chariot bumped onto the grass. Then slowly, slowly, they came to a stop.

Jack and Annie stepped out of the chariot. Jack's legs were so wobbly he could hardly walk.

Annie rushed to the horse and stroked his neck.

“Thank you.” she whispered.

Jack patted the horse's long white neck too.

“Thanks,” he said. “That was the best ride of my life.”

The horse snorted and pawed the ground

“Come on, Annie. We have to go before they find us,” said Jack.

“I don't want to leave him,” said Annie. “He's the most beautiful horse in the whole world.”

Her eyes filled with tears.

“We have to,” said Jack.

The horse put his head down and touched Annie's forehead with his soft nose. Then he gave her a gentle push toward the tree house.

Annie sniffled but started walking. Jack took her hand as they walked through the olive grove to the rope ladder of the tree house.

“You first,” Jack said.

Annie started up the ladder. Jack followed.

When they were inside, Annie hurried to the window. Jack grabbed the Pennsylvaniabook.

He pointed to a picture of the Frog Creek woods and said, “I wish—”

“Look!” said Annie.

Jack looked out the window. The horse had spread his great feathery wings. He was rising from the field.

The white horse flew high into the blue Olympian sky.

Then he disappeared behind the clouds.

“Bye!” called Annie.

A tear rolled down her cheek.

Jack pointed again at the Pennsylvania book.

“I wish we could go there,” he said.

The wind started to blow.

The tree house began to spin.

It spun faster and faster.

Then everything was still.

Absolutely still.



## 10：They’re All Here

Jack opened his eyes

It was so dark he couldn't see anything.

He felt his clothes. He was wearing his T-shirt and jeans again. The leather bag had turned back into his backpack.

“Hello,” said Morgan le Fay. Her voice came from the corner of the tree house.

“Hi!” said Annie. 

“Did you have a good journey?” asked Morgan.

“I did,” said Jack, “but girls can't do anything fun in ancient Greece.”

“I did one fun thing,” Annie said wistfully. “I rode in a chariot pulled by a flying horse.”

“That must have been wonderful,” said Morgan. “You were very lucky to be bringing me the story of Pegasus.”

“Who?” said Jack.

“Pegasus,” said Morgan. “He's the great white winged horse in Greek mythology.

“Oh, yeah,” said Jack. “I think I've heard of him.”

He felt in his backpack and found the scroll. He gave it to Morgan. He could still barely see her in the dark.

“It was written by Anonymous,” said Annie.

“I know,” said Morgan. “Many talented women used that name in the past. Her story will be a great addition to my Camelot library.

“Plato helped us find it,” said Jack.

“Ah, my good friend Plato,” said Morgan. “He was one of the greatest thinkers who ever lived.”

“And Pegasus was the greatest horse,” said Annie. She sighed. “I just wish I could see him again.”

“You can,” Morgan said softly. “He's here right now.”

“Pegasus?” cried Annie. “Oh, boy!”

Annie turned on the flashlight and used it to find her way down the rope ladder.

Jack grabbed his backpack and followed her.

When they were both standing on the ground, Annie shined her flashlight at the dark trees.

“Pegasus?” she said. “Where are you? Pegasus?”

“Turn off your flashlight, Annie,” said Morgan. She was looking down from the tree house window.

Annie switched off the light.

“In the night, you can see all the story characters that saved you on your last four missions," said Morgan. “They are all here——Hercules and the silk weaver, Sarph, the serpent monster and Pegasus.”

Jack pushed his glasses into place and studied the dark woods.

“Where are they, Morgan?” cried Annie. “Where's Pegasus?”

“Look hard,” said Morgan.

“I can't see him!” said Annie.

“Yes, you can,” said Morgan. “The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.”

Has Morgan gone crazy? wondered Jack.

“Look up,” said Morgan. “Your friends are in the night sky. They are stars.”

“Stars?” whispered Jack.

He stared at the shimmering field of tiny stars overhead.

“Hercules is a constellation,” said Morgan. The Romans imagined him kneeling in the sky, holding a club over his head.”

Morgan waved her finger at the sky. For amoment Jack saw a living, breathing Hercules outlined by stars.

“And there's the silk weaver, with her beloved cowherd” said Morgan. “The ancient Chinese believed that they were two stars on either side of the Milky Way.”

Morgan waved her hand again. The lovely silk weaver was outlined in the heavens.

“And long ago, the Irish believed the Milky Way itself was the serpent monster Sarph,” said Morgan.

Morgan waved her hand. A giant serpent glittered through the sky.
“And the ancient Greeks named one of their constellations Pegasus," said Morgan. 

She waved her hand again and the white horse's head, wings, and galloping legs glowed in the sky.

“I see him!” said Annie. Then she whispered, “I love you, Pegasus.”

Jack thought he saw the stars move as if Pegasus was rearing back in the sky.

After a breathless moment of silence, Morgan lowered her arm. The night sky became a field of tiny glittering stars again.

“You have done amazing work as Master Librarians,” said Morgan. “I would trust you with any important mission.”

“Does that mean we're going on more trips?” asked Jack.

“Indeed it does,” said Morgan. “Many more.”

Jack smiled with relief.

“When is our next mission?” asked Annie.

“As soon as I need your help, I will send for you,” said Morgan. “Go home now and rest.”

“Good-bye,” said Annie.

“Good-bye,” said Jack.

“Farewell,” said Morgan.

There was a sudden rushing of wind, then a blur of blinding light. And Morgan le Fay and the magic tree house vanished.

The night was still.

“Home?” asked Annie.

“Sure,” said Jack.

As they walked between the trees, the Frog Creek woods were pitch-black.

Jack couldn't see a thing.

But he didn't ask Annie to turn on the flashlight. For once, he wasn't worried about finding his way home.

He felt as if someone——or something——was leading them through the woods.

Morgan's words came back to him: The old stories are always with us. We are never alone.

Jack looked up at the stars again. They were beginning to fade in the growing light of dawn.

But he thought he could hear the beating of giant wings, somewhere high above.
