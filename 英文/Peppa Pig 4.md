# 1、Grandpa Pig’s Computer

Peppa and George arrived at grandpa pig’s house.

Grandpa pig. What’s this? A cuckoo clock? Yes, it goes “cuckoo, cuckoo”, but it’s broken.

Can you mend it please, grandpa ppig?

En. let’s take it to my shed.

This is grandpa pig’s shed, where grandpa mends things.

I’ll take a look inside. Grandpa now you’ve really broken it. Oh, I wonder if I got a book on clocks. Ah, here we are-how clocks work. Grandpa pig has mended the cuckoo clock Hooray. cuckoo cuckoo

Mummy pig has come to pick up Peppa and George.

Muumy, grandpa’s mended the cuckoo clock. That’s nice. What’s that?

It’s my old computer. I can’t mend that. It’s not broken. I’ve got a new computer. I thought you might like my old one.

Elm, I am not sure I really need one.

Oh, a computer. What does it do? You can do letters with it. Look, granny. And numbers.

I am afraid you might break it by pressing the wrong button. Don’t worry, you can’t break it.

Just don’t feed it milkor biscuits or jelly. The best thing it does is “Happy Mrs. Chickren”.

When you press this button, she lays an egg. I am very good at it, but  George is the best. That’s fun.

Perthaps w should keep the computer, granny pig? Goodbye, Bye Bye. Shall we do some work on the momputer, granny pig? Yes, let’s do some numbers and letters.

Peppa and her family are having lunch.

I’ve given my old computer to granny and grandpa. That’s nice. I wonder how they’re getting on with it.

Hello, Peppa pig speaking. Ah, Peppa, I need to ask a question about the computer.

It’s grandpa. He’s broken the computer. What’s the problem with the computer, grandpa pig?

It’s full of eggs. Eggs? Happy Mrs. Chickren won’t lay any more eggs. I am broken

Turn the computer off. Now turn it back on again. Did that fix it?

I am very broken. That doesn’t sound good. Maybe it can’t be mended. We’ll come around and pick it up.

Granny, we’re here to take the computer back. Oh, grandpa pig has taken it to his shed.

There. That should do it. I am mended. My grandpa is the best at mending things.

Was it very hard to mend? Not at all. I found I had this book “How computer work”.

So you don’t want us to take the computer away  now, No I need it for important work.

For letter and number work? No, to beat granny pig’s Happy Mrs. Chickren’s score.

I laid 4020 eggs. So I’ve got some work to do. Catching up.



# 2、Whistling

It's a lovely sunny morning. And Daddy Pig is reading his newspaper.

Daddy what are you doing? I’m reading the newspaper. 

You are making a funny sound. I’m whistling! Whistling is fun. You should try it!

I don’t know how to. It’s easy! Just put your lips together and blow!

Try making a smaller “O” shape. Like this! And then you could whistle a tune.

Oh, I’ve got the wrong kind of  mouth. Your mouth is fine! You just need to practice.

It’s impossible! It takes time to learn how to do important things. Like riding a bicycle or playing the piano. It took me years to learn how to wiggle my ears.

Mommy Pig is in the kitchen making cookies. What are you doing, Peppa? I’m learning to whistle. Oh, I see.

Mommy, can yo whistle? I don’t know. I’ve never tried. It takes a lot of practice. Oh, yes! Mommy Pig can whistle. You can whistle because you are old, mommy. Thank yo Peppa.

George is in the bedroom, playing with his toy rocket.

George, I’m learning to whistle. You make an “o” shape with your mouth and blow. Don’t worry George. It’s almost impossible like wiggling your ears. George can wiggle his ears. Whistling is harder. George can whistle!

What’s wrong, Peppa? I can’t whistle but everybody else can. never mind. I’m making cookies. Would you like to lip a spoon? No. Thank you, mommy can I ring Suzy sheep instead?

Hello Mrs.Pig. Hello Mrs. Sheep. Can Peppa talk to Suzy please?

Hello Suzy. Hello Peppa. What’re you doing? I’m learning to whistle but I can’t do it yet.

That sounds hard! It’s impossible. Uh... Can you whistle Suzy? No. Oh good!

I mean that’s so diffcult whistle. But good. Because I can’t whistle.

Wht’s whistle anyway? You put your lips together and blow. Like this?

Hello? Peppa? Good cookies are ready! Oh, goody, cookies.

They will be hot! You should blow on them first.

Do you not want cookie Peppa? No, thank you mommy. I think I might go outside and be on my own for a little bit.

Can you whistle yet? It’s no use daddy. I’m never going to whistle. Ever!

Have yo been practicing? Yes, lots... But it doesn’t work!

Yes need a little rest, Peppa. Here have a cookie. It’s hot. You should blow.

Oh! What’s that? It sounded like a whistle to me!

What a lovely tune! Peppa has learned how to whistle!	

I can whistle.
