# 1、Grandpa Pig’s Computer

Peppa and George arrived at grandpa pig’s house.

Grandpa pig. What’s this? A cuckoo clock? Yes, it goes “cuckoo, cuckoo”, but it’s broken.

Can you mend it please, grandpa pig?

En. let’s take it to my shed.

This is grandpa pig’s shed, where grandpa mends things.

I’ll take a look inside. Grandpa now you’ve really broken it. Oh, I wonder if I got a book on clocks. Ah, here we are-how clocks work. Grandpa pig has mended the cuckoo clock Hooray. cuckoo cuckoo

Mummy pig has come to pick up Peppa and George.

Muumy, grandpa’s mended the cuckoo clock. That’s nice. What’s that?

It’s my old computer. I can’t mend that. It’s not broken. I’ve got a new computer. I thought you might like my old one.

Elm, I am not sure I really need one.

Oh, a computer. What does it do? You can do letters with it. Look, granny. And numbers.

I am afraid you might break it by pressing the wrong button. Don’t worry, you can’t break it.

Just don’t feed it milkor biscuits or jelly. The best thing it does is “Happy Mrs. Chickren”.

When you press this button, she lays an egg. I am very good at it, but  George is the best. That’s fun.

Perthaps w should keep the computer, granny pig? Goodbye, Bye Bye. Shall we do some work on the momputer, granny pig? Yes, let’s do some numbers and letters.

Peppa and her family are having lunch.

I’ve given my old computer to granny and grandpa. That’s nice. I wonder how they’re getting on with it.

Hello, Peppa pig speaking. Ah, Peppa, I need to ask a question about the computer.

It’s grandpa. He’s broken the computer. What’s the problem with the computer, grandpa pig?

It’s full of eggs. Eggs? Happy Mrs. Chickren won’t lay any more eggs. I am broken

Turn the computer off. Now turn it back on again. Did that fix it?

I am very broken. That doesn’t sound good. Maybe it can’t be mended. We’ll come around and pick it up.

Granny, we’re here to take the computer back. Oh, grandpa pig has taken it to his shed.

There. That should do it. I am mended. My grandpa is the best at mending things.

Was it very hard to mend? Not at all. I found I had this book “How computer work”.

So you don’t want us to take the computer away  now, No I need it for important work.

For letter and number work? No, to beat granny pig’s Happy Mrs. Chickren’s score.

I laid 4020 eggs. So I’ve got some work to do. Catching up.



# 2、Whistling

It's a lovely sunny morning. And Daddy Pig is reading his newspaper.

Daddy what are you doing? I’m reading the newspaper. 

You are making a funny sound. I’m whistling! Whistling is fun. You should try it!

I don’t know how to. It’s easy! Just put your lips together and blow!

Try making a smaller “O” shape. Like this! And then you could whistle a tune.

Oh, I’ve got the wrong kind of  mouth. Your mouth is fine! You just need to practice.

It’s impossible! It takes time to learn how to do important things. Like riding a bicycle or playing the piano. It took me years to learn how to wiggle my ears.

Mommy Pig is in the kitchen making cookies. What are you doing, Peppa? I’m learning to whistle. Oh, I see.

Mommy, can yo whistle? I don’t know. I’ve never tried. It takes a lot of practice. Oh, yes! Mommy Pig can whistle. You can whistle because you are old, mommy. Thank yo Peppa.

George is in the bedroom, playing with his toy rocket.

George, I’m learning to whistle. You make an “o” shape with your mouth and blow. Don’t worry George. It’s almost impossible like wiggling your ears. George can wiggle his ears. Whistling is harder. George can whistle!

What’s wrong, Peppa? I can’t whistle but everybody else can. never mind. I’m making cookies. Would you like to lip a spoon? No. Thank you, mommy can I ring Suzy sheep instead?

Hello Mrs.Pig. Hello Mrs. Sheep. Can Peppa talk to Suzy please?

Hello Suzy. Hello Peppa. What’re you doing? I’m learning to whistle but I can’t do it yet.

That sounds hard! It’s impossible. Uh... Can you whistle Suzy? No. Oh good!

I mean that’s so diffcult whistle. But good. Because I can’t whistle.

Wht’s whistle anyway? You put your lips together and blow. Like this?

Hello? Peppa? Good cookies are ready! Oh, goody, cookies.

They will be hot! You should blow on them first.

Do you not want cookie Peppa? No, thank you mommy. I think I might go outside and be on my own for a little bit.

Can you whistle yet? It’s no use daddy. I’m never going to whistle. Ever!

Have yo been practicing? Yes, lots... But it doesn’t work!

Yes need a little rest, Peppa. Here have a cookie. It’s hot. You should blow.

Oh! What’s that? It sounded like a whistle to me!

What a lovely tune! Peppa has learned how to whistle!	

I can whistle.

Ok, Mr. Bull! How can you lift that big pipe? With my big magnet.

What are you going to do with the pipe? Um... I’m not really sure.

I know! I’ll put it down here when someone can easily find it. Now I can give you a lift home.

Oh what about Daddy? Hello. Daddy Pig, can you make your own way home? Miss Rabbit is giving us a lift.

Ok! Daddy Daddy! We went up and down, and round and round! Oh oh, I’m really sad to miss that,  see you back at home.

And around your mouth. Did grandpa hide the eggs well?

George, Richard and Edmod don’t like to be the little least ones. Don’t worry.

There will soon be even littler ones in the garden. Oh, yes. The little babies. It’s so exciting.

Grandpa already told us about the bady plants, granny. But it’s not that exciting.

We’re not talking about bady plants. Peppa. Oh, what are you talking about? Let’s go and see Jemima, Vanessa, Sarah, and Naval.

Peppa and George have fallen to sleep. When they wake up, it will be Christmas day.



# 10、Santas Visit

It’s very early on the Christmas morning. Peppa and her family are staying at granny and grandpa pig’s house. George, wake up! Santa has been! Bubble makers, comics, and tangerines.

Mommy, daddy, it’s Christmas! Hey, what? It’s too early, peppa. Go and say “Happy Christmas” to granny and grandpa.

Granny, grandpa!  What a panic! Put hands on. It’s Christmas! It’s three o’clock in the morning!

But Santa’s been. Can we see if he is still here? No, Santa is not here. Look, the carrot, drink and mince pie have gone. He has only left crumbs. Yes, Santa likes the good mince pie. And there are big presents under the tree! I asked Santa for a doll. Can we open them now?

# 14、Grampy Rabbit’s Boatyard

Peppa, George and Granny Pig are going out for a day on Grandpa Pig’s boat.

Ahoy there! Peppa and George! We are ready to go sailing. I’ll move the boat to a bit nearer.

Careful you don’t hit that big stick, grandpa! That’s a mooring post. I won’t hit it.

Grandpa, there’s a big hole in your boat. It’s just a scratch.

Grandpa’s boat is sinking. Quick, Grandpa Pig, jump off! A captain never leaves his sinking ship.

Grandpa Pig’s boat has sunk to the bottom of the river. It’s Granddad Dog.  

Ahoy there, Grandpa Pig! Lovely day for a sail. I’m...Yes, ahoy there! I’m taking my boat to the boatyard today. Going to get a few repairs done.

Would you mind taking my boat to the boatyard, too? Please... Of course. Where is you boat? Um... I’m standing on it. Oho. Has it sunk? Well, a little bit. I’m surprised your boat didn’t sink a long time ago. What? It’s a better boat than that rust bucket of yours.

Grandpa Pig and Granddad Dog are very best friends. 

Catch this, captain! Aye, aye! Skip up! Granddad’s truck has lifted Grandpa Pig’s boat out of the water.

Next stop, the boatyard.

What’s the boatyard?  A boatyard, Peppa, is where broken boats get mended. 

This is Grampy Rabbit’s boatyard. Ahoy there. Me hearties! Ahoy there, Grampy Rabbit!. Who did that to your boat, Grandpa Pig? Um... Someone drove it into a mooring post. It went rush and made a big hole there. You should never let other people steer your boat, Grandpa Pig. Um... Yes, can you mend it? Of course, I just need to size up the damage.

Grampy Rabbit is measuring the hole in Grandpa Pig’s boat. Now, I need to find something to patch it up. It must be good to know how to mend a boat. Oh, it takes years to learn how to mend a boat.

How long have you been mending boats? Years. Grampy Rabbit has collected lots of scrap metal to mend boats bit. Now this is a gold mine. It’s a pile of rubbish!  But you can make things from pile of rubbish.

Like what? Like submarine!

Grampy Rabbit has made a submarine out of rubbish. Does it actually work? Watch this. It fills up with water, so it’s very good at going down. But not so good at coming back up.

Now this is what I’ve been looking for. It’s a washing machine. It’s the fix for Grandpa Pig’s boat is what it is. You are going to mend my boat with a bit of washing machine? Yes.

That’s as good as new! Now we test it. Prepare for launch. Aye, aye! Amazing! It floats. You sound surprised. Yes, usually they sink on the first go. Now we can go for our day on the river. What a splendid idea. This is the life out on a boat with just the sea and the sky! I knwo a song about the sea and sky. Do you want to hear it? No, thank you. Yes, please. 

I got up this morning. The sea was still there, so was the sky.

No, that’s surely for big athletes like me. Not for little explorers like you. We are not explorers. I’ll make exporers of you. But you, you look like a super hero. It’s just pretent. Pretending, that’s good. Right, let’s warm up.

Everyone run on the spot and flap your arms. Now, stretch. Stretch. Wobble like a jelly. And, rest. Now we’re all warmed up. We can start. Start what? Your adventure. I want you to pretend that this room is a jungle. It’s doesn’t look like a jungle. Where ‘re the trees? You have to imagine it. The trees, the rain, the fast clean river at your feet. Your first adventure is to walk on this beam across the river. That’s easy! But it’s night time and it’s windy. What’s ? That now it was for me. It was a dark and stormy night.

I was on an adventure. Ready? But it’s not windy or night time. You have to pretend.

Everyone crosses the pretend river safely. Hurray! Well done! My little explorers. What’s next? Grampy Rabbit? Your next adventure is to swim across this swamp full of crocodiles. I can’t see any crocodiles. You’ve got to pretent. Let those crocodiles know who’s boss. Go away! You naughty crocodiles. That’s spirit. 

Did you ever swim across a crocodile swamp? Of corese, I did. Were you scared? Not scared as they were of me. Ready? Don’t forget to do the call. Everyone has crossed the pretend crocodile swamp safely. Well done! What’s our next adventure? That is a fort, big athlete jump over it, like this. But you can pretend it’s a dinosaur, and crawl through its legs.Have you crawled through a dinosaur’s legs Grampy Rabbit? Oh, yes. Once I was walking in the jungle. When I stumbles into  a lost world of dinosaur. And that’s it! You’ve made it out of a jungle. Hurray!

Did you have a good gym class, children? Yes, Madame Gazelle. They’re real little explorers now.

We walked across a river. And we swam over crocodiles. And we crawled down to a dinosaur. I love doing Gym Class with Grampy Rabbit.

Peppa and George are playing at Zoe Zebra’s house. Little Zuzu and Zaza are making a jungle with play-clay. George has made a dinosaur out of play-clay. Peppa and Zoe are having a dolls’ picnic. 

Hello, Mr. Monkey. Would you like a cup of tea?  Monkey says yes. What’s the magic word, Mr. Monkey? That means please. Oh! We haven’t got a tea-set. We could make a tea-set out of play-clay.

Yes. George,  Can we use your play-clay please? No. Zuzu, Zaza, we need to make a tea-set for our tea party. No. you can help us make it. I’ll make the teapot. And we’ll make the cups. There. Now monkey can have tea. 

Oh! This teapot is too soft. Real tea-sets aren’t soft. My mummy makes real pots. She does pottery.

Mummy, can you help us make a tea-set, Please. Real teacups and a teapot that we can put real water in. Okay. Come with me.

This is where Mrs. Zebra makes her pottery. 

Let’s make this tea-set. What’s that. Clay. All pottery start off like that. That is soft, like play-clay. We need it to be soft, so we can shape it. But later it won’t be slfo.

Mummy Zebra is making a little cup on the potter’s wheel. 

There, one cup. That looks easy. Would you like to try? Yes, please. It’s all slimy. Ah, it’s all gone wrong.

Making a cup on a potter’s wheel is not easy.

There is an easier way to make a cup. First, roll the clay into a long worm, like this. It’s a wriggly worm! I’m a wriggly worm. I’m made of clay. What shall I make today? 

We wrap it round and round like this. It’s a bit bumpy. No, I smooth the jolt with my hands and I add a handle. It’s a cup. Now we have two cups. Yes, but a tea-set needs more than two cups. We’ll all meke cups. Yes. Dinosaur. George has made a dinosaur. George always makes dinosaurs. What a scary dinosaur! 

Now we need to bed the tea-set in kiln. A kiln is an oven, cooks the clay and makes it hard. The tea-set should be ready. Hooray. Now we paint them.

The children are painting the tea-set lovely bright colors. The tea-set is finished. Now we can have our tea party. There is a cup for everyone. Oh, we forget to make a teapot. I know. George’s dinosaur can be the teapot.

Yes, let’s fill it with water. This is the best tea-set in the world! Everybody knows that all the finest tea-sets have a dinosaur in them. Teapot.

What’s that? Someone hides and we all try to find them. That sounds like “Hide and seek”. But when you find them,  You keep quiet and hide in the same space until everyone is hiding there. Like sardines in a tin. All right. Let’s try it. 

George, you hide first. One, two, three... George is looking for simewhere to hide. Nine ten.

Ready or not, here we come. George, I can see your wiggly tail. 

Peppa is hiding with George. Move over, George. Found you. Now, Chloe must squeeze in with Peppa and George. Move up. There you all are. Now, Belinda Bear must squeeze in. too. Good job. We’re like sardines in a tin.  

Where’s everyone gone?  Surprise. Can we stop running around now? Yeah. Let’s just chew out. Chew out? What’s that? 

We just sit around and talk about stuff. I like talking. Blah...blah...blah... Let’s talk about music. I dig blue’s music. I like red’s music. I like green’s music. We don’t like children’s music. No, no, no.

Wht music are you into? I like this. It’s very grown-up.

Head, shoulders, kness and toes, knees and toes. Head, shoulders, kness and toes, knees and toes. And eyes and ears and mouth and nose...

Peppa. George. It’s time to go home now. You will see Chloe again soon. I’m coming to your house next week, peppa. Can we come along, too? You can come. But we will be playing games. We like playing games with Peppa and George. Hooray

You can still have fun playing games. Even when you’re almost grown up.

# 25、Champion Daddy Pig

Peppa and her family are watching sport on television. 

It’s a long jump. It’s a new world record! Mummy, what’s a world record? It means you are best in the world at something. Then you are a champion, and you name goes in a book. There are champions for running, jumping, swimming. I wish you were in the book, daddy. I am in the book. No!

Yes, Daddy Pig is champion puddle jumper. No one’s beaten me yet. I don’t think they ever will. 

The next event is the puddle jump. That was a very big splash. In fact, I think yes! It’s a new world record.

Daddy, you are not the champion anymore. Everyone will be sad. I’m sure they’ve got more important things to worry about, Peppa. 

Daddy pig, you lost the world record. Everyone wants you to be champion again. It’s important. Really? Yes. Ok. I’ll do it tomorrow. Hurray! But I’ll have to train myself to jump in muddy puddles again. Everyone knows how to jump in muddy puddles, daddy.

Aha, but not everyone is a champion, Peppa. Daddy Pig is the master.

Daddy, are you going to practice jumping up and down? No Peppa. I must be at one with puddle. What? To jump in a puddle, I must think like a puddle. Do you need to do running? No. Do you need to do press-ups? No. I need to sleep and dream about puddles.

It’s the day of the big puddle jump. Daddy Pig is wearing his puddle jumping costume. I can’t find my golden boots. I gave those old boots to grandpa for his gardening. My lucky golden boots to be used as gardening boots! You’ve got other ones. It’s not the same.

Hello? Grandpa,  remember those old boots I gave you? Uh... yes? Daddy needs them back urgently. You have been looking after them? Um... they have been watered.

Grandpa Pig is growing tomatoes in daddy’s lucky boots. 

We need them for the puddle jump today. Right, I’ll meet you there.

Everyone has come to watch daddy pig’s puddle jump.

Please welcome your friend and mine  Mr. Potato. 

Good luck, daddy pig. Oh, but where are your lucky boots? Uh, here they are. 

Thank you, Grandpa Pig. I can smell tomatoes. 

And now for Daddy Pig’s puddle jump.

Daddy pig is thinking. Ready, steady, go!  I must become one with the puddle. I must be the puddle.

The puddle has gone! The puddle has gone over all of us. 

Daddy pig has become one with the puddle. Everyone has become one with the puddle.

It’s a new world record! Hurray! Champion daddy pig! And who is this? I’m Peppa Pig.One day I will be the champion puddle jumper. I’ve been training her.

Um... to be trained by the master. What have you learned?

Um... if you jump in muddy puddles. you must wear your boots.



# 26、The Blackberry Bush

Peppa and her family are at Granny and Grandpa Pig’s house.

Today, I’m going to make apple and blackberry crumbles. Yummy! I need you bravest explorers to go and get the fruit. Aye! Aye Granny Pig!

We’ve got baskets for the apples. And buckets for the blackberries.

First, the easy bit picking apples. On the count of three, shake the tree. One, two, three. Now for the blackberries. Why don’t we just have apple crumble? Because blackberries are tasty too, Grandpa. Ok, Now the hard bit.

Now that’s what I call a blackberry bush. This bush has been here since I was a little piggy. It’s an overgrown weed. I should’ve cut it down years ago. Grandpa, why don’t you like it? I don’t like the way it looks at me. 

Silly Grandpa. It’s just a harmless bush. And it’s covered in lovely blackberries.

George has seen some really big juicy blackberries. 

Careful George, or you might get tangled. I have a stick for picking hard-to-reach blackberries.

Clever Grandpa! But the best blackberries are right at the very top. that’s why I brought the ladder.

Um, don’t lean too far over, Mummy Pig. Don’t worry. I’ve been climbing this Blackberry bush since I was a little girl. Yes, but you are nit a little girl now. I know what I’m doing.

Oh, dear! Mummy Pig has fallen into the blackberry bush. Mummy! Can you get out? No, I’m stuck. You’re stuck in the thorny bush like Sleep Beauty. What?

Once upon a time, There was a princess called Sleeping Beauty. One day shee fell asleep in a thorny bush. And she stayed there for a hundred years. That’s a nice story, Peppa. 

It is Susie Sheep. Hello Peppa. Hello Susie. My Mummy is in a blackberry bush. And she’ll be there for a hundred years. Like Sleep Beauty? And she’ll be rescued by a handsome prince who will give her a kiss. Mu mummy is having an adventure. I wish my mummy  would have adventures like that. 

Um, can someone think of a way to get me out of here? Don’t worry, Mummy. In a hundred years a handsome prince will rescue you. I’ll be that handsome prince. Grandpa Pig, May I borrow yhour pruning shears please? Of course you may, Brave Sir Daddy Pig.

Stand back everyone. Take that you thorny bush you. Hurray! Oh, my prince. My Princess. You were meant to stay in there for a hundred years! That was quite ling enough. Thank you.

Mummy is a blackberry bush. I thought this sort of thing onlyu happened tome! Stand still while we pick you.

Let’s take all this fruit back to Granny Pig.

Granny! Granny Mummy had an adventure! And then Mummy fell in a bush. She looked quite silly and she was going Ah-! help me!

And then Daddy came and rescued her. The end.

Thank you, Peppa. I think we’ve all heard that story enough times now. But it’s funny. I never want to see another blackberry in my life. So you don’t want to any apple and blackberry crumble then.

Well. Mmmm, Delicious. Mummy Pig loves apple and blackberry crumble.

Everyone loves apple and blackberry crumble.
