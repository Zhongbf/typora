There she was. Standing under a tall oak tree. “Look,” she said. She was pointing at a repe ladder

The longest repe ladder Jack had ever seen

“Wow,” he whispered
”哇“，杰克低声嘀咕.

The ladder went all the way up to the top of the tree
这绳梯一直向上到达树顶

There - at the top - was a tree house. It was tucked  between two branches（`at the top 是插入语`）
哪里顶上有一座树屋，它被夹在两根树枝之间

“That must be the highest tree house in the world,” said Annie.
“那一定是世界上最高的树屋了。”安妮说

“Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.”
“它是谁盖的？” 杰克问。“我以前从没见过”

“I don’t know But I’m going up,” said Annie
“我不知道，但我打算爬上去。”安妮说。

“No, We don’t know who it belongs to,” said Jack
“不行，我们不知道树屋属于谁的，” 杰克说。

Annie disappeared inside the tree hose.
安妮消失在树屋里面

“An-nie!”
安——妮

Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her head out of the tree house window.
杰克等了一会。他刚要在喊一次，安妮就把脑袋从树屋的窗户伸出来

“Books!” she shouted.

## Chapter2：The Monster（怪兽）

Jack crawled through a hole in the tree house floor.
杰克从树屋地板上的一个洞里爬了进去

Wow. The tree house was filled with books. Books everywhere. Very old books with dusty covers. New books with shiny, bright covers. 
哇，这树屋的确堆满了书，到处都是书。有封面满是灰尘的很老很老旧书，也有封面光鲜亮丽的新书

“Look. You can see far, far away,” said Annie. She was peering out tree house window.
看，你能看得很远很远，安妮说着。从树屋的窗口向外望去

Jack looked out the window with her. Down below were the tops of the other trees. In the distance he saw the Frog Creek library. The elementary school. The park
杰克和她一起看向窗外，下面是其他树的顶部。在远处，他看见蛙溪镇的图书馆、小学、还有公园

Annie pointed in the other direction.
安妮指向另一个方向

“There’s  our house,” she said.
那是我们的家，她说。

Sure enough. There was their white wooden house with the green porch. Next door was their neighbor’s black dog, Henry. He looked very tiny.
果然，那正是他们的家，有着绿色走廊的白色木屋。隔壁是他们邻居家的黑狗，亨利。它看上去非常小

“Hi Henry!” shouted Annie.
嘿，亨利！安妮大声喊到。

“Shush!” said Jack. “We’re not supposed to be up here.”
嘘！杰克说。我们没有被允许上来这里的

He glanced around the tree house again.
他又扫视了一次树屋

“I wonder who owns all these books,” he said. He noticed bookmarks were stick out  of many of them
我想知道这些书是谁的，他说。他注意到很多书插着书签。

“I like this one,” said Annie.  She held up a book with a castle on the covers.
我喜欢这本书，安妮说。他举起一本封面上又一座城堡的书

“Here‘s a book about Pennsylvania,” said Jack, He turned to the page with the book-mark
这里有一本关于宾夕法尼亚州的书，杰克说。他翻到插有书签的那一页

“Hey, there’s a picture of Frog Creek in here,” said Jack. “It’s a picture of these woods!”
嘿，这里有一副蛙溪镇的图片。杰克说。这张图片就是画的这座森林！

“Oh, here’s a book for you,” said Annie. She help up a book about dinisaurs. A blue silk bookmark was sticking put of it
噢，这本书给你，安妮说。她举起一本关于恐龙的书。书上面还粘贴着一个蓝色丝绸书签

“Let me see it.” Jack set down his back-pack and grabbed the book from her.
让我看看。杰克放下背包，从安妮手里抢过书

“You look at that one, and I’ll look at the one about castles,“ said Annie.
你看那本吧，我去看那本关于城堡的，安妮说。

“No, we beeter not,” said Jack. “We don’t know who these books belong to.”
不要，我们最好不要这样，杰克说，我们不知道这些书是属于谁的

But even as he said this, Jack opened there dinosaur book to where the bookmark was. He couldn’t help himself.
但是虽然他这么说，杰克打开了那本恐龙书，找到书签的地方，他控制不住自己

He turned to a picture of an ancient flying reptile. A Pteranodon.
他翻到一张古老飞行爬行动物图片。一只无齿翼龙

He touched the huge bat-like wings.|
他摸了摸图片上那巨大像蝙蝠一样的翅膀

“Wow,” whispered Jack. “I wish I could see Pteranodon for real.”

The Pteranodon was soaring through the sky. The ground was covered with ferns and tall grass. There was a winding stream. A sloping hill. And volcanoes in the distance.
翼龙在天空翱翔。地面上长满了蕨类植物和高大的草。有一条蜿蜒的小溪，一个斜坡。远处还有火山

“Wh---where are we?” stammered Jack.
哪儿——我们在哪儿? 杰克结结巴巴的说

The Pteranodon glided down to the base of their tree. The creature coasted to a stop. And stood very still.
翼龙滑翔到他们那棵树的底部。那生物滑着停了下来。然后一动不动的站着

“What happened to us?” said Annie. She looked at Jack. He looked at her.

“And we landed here,” said Jack
然后我们到这里，杰克说

“And we landed here,” said Annie.

“So that means . . .” said Jack
所以着意味着……，杰克说。

“So that means . . . what?” said Annie.
所以着意味着……什么？安妮问道

“Nothing,” said Jack. He shook his head. “None of this can be real.”
没什么，杰克说，他摇了摇他的头。这些都不可能是真的

Annie looked out the window again. “But he’s real,” she said. “He’s very real”
安妮再一次看向窗外，但是它是真的，他说。它绝对是真的

Jack looked out the window with her. The Pteranodon was standing at the base of the oak tree. Like a guard. His giant wings were spread out on either side of him.

杰克低头看那本书，他读着图画后面的内容

​		This flying reptile lived in the Cretaceous period. It vanished 65 million years ago.

“Jack,” said Annie. “He’s nice.”
杰克，安妮说。它好可爱啊

“Nice?”
