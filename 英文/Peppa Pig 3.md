# 1、Compost

Daddy Pig is making vegetable soup for lunch.

Daddy, can I help?

Thank you, Peppa.

Can you clear away all these vegetables peelings?

Ok. Stop, Peppa.

Vegetable peelings don’t go in the normal bin. They go in this brown bin.

 Banana. That’s right, George. It’s a banana skin.

And there are onions and carrots and all sorts of fruit and vegetable leftovers in there.

Granny and Grandpa will like these. Do Granny and Grandpa Pig eat potato peelings?

No, Peppa. They’re for Grandpa’s garden.

They help his plants grow.

We can take these round there after lunch. Oh, goody.

Mymmy Pig and Peppa and George are taking the vegetable peeling over to Granny and Grandpa Pigs house.

We are here. Hurry. Grandpa Pig, Grandpa Pig.

We’re got a special present for you. Ah. Vegetable peelings.

Fantastic. My garden will like these.

Does your garden eat vegetables?

No Peppa. These peelings are for my compost heap.

What’s that?

I’ll show you. Here it is.

It’s a wooden box. Yes Peppa.

But it’s a very clever wooden box.

I put these peelings in the top and then out of the bottom comes lovely rich earth. Call ‘compost’

How does it do that? Is it a magic box? Hoho. No, Peppa.

I’ve got some little friends that give it some help.

Where? In here. Look. Ah Wriggly worm. Wiggle, wiggle.

The worms turned all the fruit and vegetable into compost.

Grandpa, can we find some more wriggly worms for your composting.

What a good idea!

Come on, George. Let’s find some more wriggly worms.

A wriggly worm. Wiggle! Wiggle!

You are a wiggly worm. How do you do? I love you. You are a wiggly worm.

Haha! Well done! Be a good wiggly worm. And turn it all into compost.

Then, I can use the compost to... I know, I know.

You put a seed in the ground, cover it in compost. And then it grows into a tree.

Hoho. Yes, Peppa. And talking of trees, we’d better and help Granny Pig.

She’s collecting fruit in the orchard.

What’s the orchard? It’s where you find fruit three.

We’ve had this orchard since I was a little piggy.

Hello, Granny Pig. Are you going to help me collect some apples? 

Yes, Granny. Oh, the apples are too high up.

Don’t worry, Peppa. Grannd and Granny have a little trick to collect the apples.

Everybody hold on to the tree.

On the count of three shake the tree as mush as you can. 

One two, three! 

It’s raining apples! 

Granny, can we have an apple please? Of course, Peppa. Mm... delicious

And can you guess what we do with the apple corse?

Wiggle, wiggle. That’s right.

The apple cores go into the compost for the worms.

clever George. And clever wiggly worms, too.



# 2、Washing

Daddy Pig is doing the washing this morning.

Daddy, what’s that shirt? It’s my football shirt.

Daddy Pig is playing football this afternoon. But first I have to go to work.

See you later! Bye! 

Poor Dady, having to go to work. Oh, poor Dady!

Come on! Let’s play! Yes, let’s play.

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

George loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Munny Pig loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Od, dear. Mummy! We splashed daddy’s football shirt with mud.

Oh, Don’t worry! We’ll just wash it. It will be washed in no time. 

And daddy won’t know it was ever muddied.

Let’s find more things to put in the machine. Oh, my dress is a bit muddy.

Mummy Pig and George have found more things to wash. Very good, Goerge.

We put the clothes in here. And then we switch it on. 

The washing machine is filling up with hot, slippery water. Splosh. Splosh

The washing machine is making the whole room shake.

Oh, peppa, where’s your dress? I am washing it. What? Oh, no.

Look Mummy, my red dress is all nice and clean.

Yes Peppa, But look what’s it done to everything else. Oh Dear.

Peppa’s red dress has made the white clothes pink.

Pink isn’t a very good color for a football shirt.

Daddy Pig is home from work. Hello, everyone. Hello Daddy. 

Eh, Daddy Pig, we’ve got a bit of a problem and mm... Tell me later, Mummy Pig.

I have to get ready for football. Now, where’s my football shirt. Here. 

Don’t be silly, Peppa. That’s one of Mummy’s dresses. It’s pink.

No, Daddy. It’s you football shirt. It’s got a bit muddy. So we wash it.

And it all went a bit wrong. Sorry, Daddy.

But I can’t wear a pink football shirt. Why not, Daddy? Pink is a lovely color.

What do you think George? Yuk. George not like pink.

Here are Daddy Pig’s friends. Mr.Bull, Mr.Rabbit, Mr.Pony and Mr.Zebra.

Mu! This Daddy Pig comes at a parade. He’ll just be in a moment.

My team are i white. I need a white shirt. 

But Daddy, you have the white shirt. Just take off your jacket. See?

Fantastic! Thank you, Peppa.

Hello, everyone. Hello, Daddy Pig. I like your shirt! Very smart!

Thank you. Come on, let’s play football.

Daddy, you’re made your shirt all muddy. Of coures, Peppa.

Football shirts are meant to be muddy.

Daddy Pig loves playing football. Everyone loves playing football, especially when it’s muddy.



# 3、Richard Rabbit Comes to play

Peppa and George are playing in their bedroom. This will be the best house ever!

George, Richard Rabbit is here. George! Richard! Dinosaur!

Bye bye, Richard. I’ll back to pick you up later!

George and Richard are best friends.

George! Richard! You’re knocked my house down. Please play something not bouncy.

George has made the toy basket into a volcano. Richard is using toy trees to make a jungle.

George has used building blocks to make a river. Dinosaur!

George and Richard have turned the bedroom into dinosaur land.

I leave it. It’s too noisy. 

I say potato. And I say potato.

The good thing about rainy days is we got to watch important TV programs.

Mommy, George and Richard have made the bedroom into dinosaur land. And dinosaur land is very noisy.

George has his best friend here, but I’ve got no one to play with.

You could ask Susie Sheep to come over. Susie Sheep is Peppa’s best friend.

Can Susie really come over now? Ler’s ring her.

Mie! Hellp, Susie Sheep’s speaking. Susie, it’s me. Can you come to my house now?

Yes Peppa! Can I wear my nurse’s costume? Yes, But come quickly.

Bye bye, Susie! I’ll be back to... Quick Susie, pick you up later.

George! Richard! Nurse Susie is here. And nurse Suise says this is not dinosaur land.

It’s a hospital. And a hospital must be clean and tidy.

The bedroom is not dinosaur land anymore. It is a hospital.

I am an important doctor. This dinosaur look sick.  I agree, doctor. He’s a very greeny-ill color.

He must go to bed. And this dinosaur looks very purply-ill color.

Yes, doctor. He must go to bed, too. Dinosaur! Sh-sh! Quick in the hospital.

The bedroom is not a hospital anymore. Now it’s a railway station.

No! No! There aren’t any trains in fairyland. Oh, now the bedroom is fairyland.

Only pretty things are allowed in fairyland.

What’s all this crying about? George and Rickard want to play dinosaurs and trains.

And we want to play hospitals and fairies. 

Uh, I see the rain has stopped outside. So? So maybe you could all play outside.

But they like little boy’s games. And we like grown-up girls’ games.

But after it’s been raining in the garden, what yo normally  find...

Muddy? Puddles! And what are muddy puddles for? Jumping up and down in!

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, whether they’re big girls or little boys.



# 4、The Rainbow

Peppa and her family are going for a drive to the mountains.

Are we nearly there yet? Not yet, Peppa.

Ho, ho, ho... What color is our car? Ah, it’s red. I win! I win!

The family have arrived at the mountains.

We’ll have a fantastic view when we get to the top. We are here. Great!

Look at the lovely Sunny view.

Oh, dear. It is started to rain. Where is the lovely view? Ah, there is the lovely view.

It’s Miss Rabbit’s ice cream store. Hello, Miss Rabbit! Hello, Daddy Pig!

Four ice creams, please! What flavors would you like?

Mint, orange, strawberry and blueberry, please. Ok!

Look what I’ve got! Icecream!

There are favorite colors. That’s right. Green for me! Orange for me! Strawberry red for me! And George is...

Blue! Yummy... Look, the sun has come out!

And look what else has come out? A rainbow! 

Peppa and George love rainbow! A rainbow only comes out when it’s rainy and sunny at the same time!

It’s got all our favorite colors in it.

Yes. Red, and orange, and green, and blue. And do you know what you find in the end of the rainbow?

No! You find treasure. Oh, can we go to find the treasure now? 

OK! the end of the rainbow looks like just on the next hill. Let’s go. Wee.

It’s a rainy sunny day, the rainbow is here to play. Rainbow, rainbow, red and orange and yellow and green and purple and blue. Rainbow, rainbow. It’s rainy sunny day!

Here we are! Oh, where are the rainbow gone? 

It’s moved to the next hill. You tricky rainbow. Quick! Let’s catch it.

Rainbow, rainbow, it’s rainy sunny day! It’s stopped raining! And the rainbow is gone! 

Don’t worry, George.

Maybe the rainbow has left some treasure behind. There is something over here.

Have you found the rainbow’s treasure? Yes. I have.  A big muddy puddle! Great!

This is the best rainbow treasure ever.



# 5、The Camper Van

Peppa and George are very excited today. They are going on holiday.

Oh, Where is daddy? He is bringing a secret surprise. What’s that?

It’s a camper van. We’ve borrowed it for a holiday. This camper van has everything.

This button works the sink. And this button works the TV..

What does this button do? I am not sure. Maybe don’t press it until we know.

Is everybody ready to do on holiday? Yes mummy pig. Then let’s go!

We are going on holiday in a camper van. En, this map is a bit tricky.

Daddy, we don’t want to get lost. Don’t worry, Peppa. I’m an expert  in map reading.

Oh, that’s strange. Are we lost? Err yes. It’s Granddad dog with Danny dog. 

Hello Peppa, Hello Danny. We’re lost. Lost? Is your Sat navi broke? Sat navi?

You are driving a camper van T32 hundred, sat navi comes a standard.

Wecome to the car of the future. Ah, so that’s what that button does.

Where are we going today? The camper vanis talking. Clever isn’t it.

The computer’s voice helps you find your way. But how does it know where we want to do?

You tell it. Hello Mrs. camper van. Hello. We’re going on a holiday.

Can you tell us the way? Proceed on the current road in a straight line.

Thanks for your help, Granddad dog.

You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!

We’re going on a holiday in a camper van. Danger, danger, oil is low. What’s oil?

Oil helps engines to run smoothly. Will the oil run out? No, these warnings always give you plenty of time.

Oil is gone. Oh dear. Luckily I’ve got a spare can of oil. Will done, Daddy Pig.

We simply pour the oil into the engine and ... What’s wrong? 

There’s nothing in here. The engine’s gone. It’s mummy sheep with Suzy sheep.

Hello Suzy! Hello Peppa! We’ve lost our engine. Lost your engine?

Yes, it’s completely disappeared. I’d like to help, but I  don’t know a thing about engines.

I’m probably just being silly, but this looks a bit like an engine?

Ah, yes, well-spotted Mummy sheep. The camper van has its engine at the back.

There, that should be enough oil. Thank you Mummy Sheep!

You are welcome. Have a lovely holiday!  

Are we near there yet? Just up the next hill. You have reached your destination. TIme for bed.

Where will we sleep? Mummy pig and I will sleep on this bed.

And you two will sleep upstairs. But there isn’t an upstairs. Watch this.

The camper van’s roof is lifting up. The camper van is just like our little house.

While we are on holiday, it is our little house. Goodnight my little piggies.



# 6、Camping Holiday

Peppa’s family are on a holiday in the camp van. Good morning, my little piggies. Good morning, Daddy Pig.

I love camping. Since we are in the countryside, I thought we can spend the day looking at nature.

Good idea! Mummy pig. Let’s watch a nature program. 

One of the wonders of nature--Birds. How lovely. Shoo, shoo, little birdy, we can’t hear our TV.

Oh! Daddy Pig, there is no point being on a camping holiday and just watching TV.

We can do that at home. Hum... Good thinking, Mummy Pig.

There’re lots of fun places we can visit. There’s tree world. What’s tree world?

Tree world is a big forest full of trees.  It sounds a bit boring. Or there is potato city? What’s potato city?

There’s a tour with potato fields ending with a potato tasting. Sounds interesting.

Or there is Duckland. What’s Duckland? It’s a wide river full of ducks.

Duckland! Let’s go to Duckland. Peppa and George love ducks.

How do we get to Duckland? Camp van can guide us. Hello! Where are we going today?

Duckland, please. Follow the road ahead in a straight line.

We’re going to Duckland in a camp van. Welcome to Duckland. How many tickets please?

Two adults and two children. Enjoy the ducks. Where are the ducks?

Maybe they are on holiday. Let’s have our picnic lunch. The ducks always turn up...

When we have picnics. Peppa and George love picnics. Look! It’s the duck.

Stop daddy. We need bread for the ducks. Hoho, all right.

Hello Mrs. Duck! Here come more ducks. All the brothers and sisters are here. And here come more ducks.

It’s a Grammy and a Grandpa ducks. And here are all the aunties and uncles.

That’s the last of our picnic gone. Ducks, say thank you to daddy pig. You are most welcome.

I love Duckland. It is time to go home. I wonder what’s the shortest way home.

Drive straight ahead into the river. Oh! Are you sure?

Yes, drive into the river. But we can’t drive in the river. Yes, it’s talking nonsense.

Please press the blue button. The camper van is driving into the river.

Our camper van has turned into a boat. I wasn’t quite expecting that. 

Welcome to the car of the future. Look! It’s granddad dog and Danny dog. Ahoy, there! Daddy pig.

Ahoy, there. Sailing on a river in a camper van. Drive up the next hill.

You have reached your destination. We are home.

Thank you for your lovely holiday Mrs.Camper van. Your are most welcome.

It’s nice going on a holiday but it’s nicer to be backing our own little house.

Goodnight my little piggies.



# 7、Delphine Donkey

Hello, Daddy pig speaking. Something is wrong with the phine.

You see, the phone is talking nonsense.

That was Monsieur Donkey, he was speaking French. Ha, I thought as much.

Mummy, what did monsteur Donkey say? He asked if little Delphine Donkey could visit us. 

Delphine Donkey is Peppa’s very special friend from France.

Delphine’s coming to practice talking English with us. Hooray. We’d better hurry.

Delphine’s train is arriving any minute. Last stop, all change. That’s Delphine’s train!

Delphine! Bonjour! “Bonjour” means “Hello” in French. 

My goodness, is that huge case for Delphine? Yes, Delphine has brought a few little things for her visit.

Things you do not have over here, cheese, bread, tomatoes, water...

I’ll be back to  pick you  up tomorrow night. Where should I put Delphine’s luggage?

In my room, at the very top of the house. And this luggage is for one night stay? 

Oh yes, this is why  I only pack a little bag. Now, Delphine is here to practice talking English, so we must all help her.

Yes, mummy. First, I must say sorry, I do not speak English very well. You don’t speak too badly.

You are very kind, Monsieur Pig. But may I ask you a question about talking English?

Of course, I am an expert at taking. Ask away. Are English split infinitives a from of irregular verb, or past pronoun?

Actually it’s quite late, shall we set up Delphine’s bed. Mummy, mummy, can Delphine sleep in my bed,  with a pillow at each end? Good idea, Peppa.

Peppa and Delphine are sleeping  at each end of the same bed. Now children, try to go to sleep.

You’ll get a busy day tomorrow. Delphone is visiting your play group.

Dromez bien is French for “sleep well”

I’m not sleepy at all. Let’s sing a little song to make us sleepy. Yes.

Delphine’s pretty French song has sent everyone to sleep.

Delphine has come to Peppa’s play group. Madame Gazelle, this is my French friend - Delphine Donkey.

Delphine sang a pretty French song last night. Can we teach her an English song?

How about “The Bing-bong Sone”? Yes, sing me this “Bing-bong song”. It would be good for my English.

Good, I have learnt lots of English words.



# 8、Fun Run

It has been very stormy weather and the school roof is leaking. How can we raise the money to fix the school roof?

We could have a fun run. What’s a funny run? It’s a day for picnics and giving money to see people run.

The more money you give, the futher they run. Good idea, daddy pig!

How far can you run?  What? Eh...well, I can run as far as you like. But daddy, you can hardly run at all!

Nonsense! I am an expert at running!  Good. Does anyone else want to run? No, thank you! 

But I will give money to see daddy pig run! Me too! And me! Excellent! Thank you, daddy pig!

Peppa and her family are eating spaghetti. Delicious! Is there any more spaghetti? Daddy Pig! 

You’ve already had three things! Eating gives me energy. And I need energy for my fun run.

If you also need a practice running. What if I practice eating today then practice running tomorrow?

No, daddy. You need to practice running now. Come on daddy! Race you!

This is easy. It is easy to run downhill.  It is hard to run uphill.

I don’t think I should’ve eaten so much spaghetti.

It is the day of the fun run. Madame Gazelle has a chart to show how far daddy pig must run.

It daddy pig can run to here. The supermarket! Then to here. Granddad dog’s garage. And all the way to here. WIndy castle. Then we will have enough money to fix the school roof.

I will do it now. Ready, stready, go!  I did it! Now we can have the picnic.

Silly daddy! That is just a drawing. 

Yes, now you must run to the real windy castle. Ready, steady, go! 

Come on, daddy pig! You can make it! Come on, bus! You can make it! 

The school bus has made it to the windy castle. Now everyone can enjoy the picnic.

Water... water... What a lovely hot day! It’s such a relaxing way to raise money, too!

Daddy pig has reached the supermarket. All running makes him very thirsty.

Let’s look through the telescope. I can see daddy. 

The telescope makes everything look closer. He’s not going very fast.

Daddy pig has arrived at Grand daddy dog’s garage. 

That’s it. I can’t go on! Daddy has stopped. You look rather hot. You need something to cool you down and give you energy. Have an ice lolly. Thank you, Granddad dog.

That’s nice... a wasp! Shoo, shoo, get you away, you little pest.

The wasp wants to share daddy pig’s ice lolly.

No, this is my lolly. Daddy starts running again, really fast.

You can stop now, daddy pig. We have enough money to fix the school roof.

Daddy pig has lost the wasp. Well done. daddy pig. All that extra running means we’ve got enough money for a now school bus tool. 

Thank you daddy pig. You’re most welcome.



# 9、Work and Play

It is a lovely sunny morning. 

Ah! What a nice day for doing nothing!

Daddy pig loves doing nothing.

Daddy, aren’t you going to work today?

No, Peppa, it’s Saturday.

Daddy pig doesn’t work on Saturdays.

Daddy pig, you’ll be late for work!

We’ve been shopkeepers.

Blah, blah, blah... The end and print.

Mummy pig has finished her works.

Naughty mummy! You are playing Happy Mrs. Chicken.

Ah, that’s because George and I have finished our work, haven’t we George?

We’ve all finished our work, so let’s all play.

 

# 10、The Fire Engine

Mummy pig is dressed as a fireman.

Mummy, why are you dressed like that?

I’m going to the mummy’s fire engine practice.

This is just a good excuse for a cup of tea and a chat.

Well, what are you doing today, daddy pig?

I’ve got a very important meeting with the daddy’s football team.

That’s just a lot of grown-up boys kicking a football around.

We are having a barbecue as well.

Here are Mr. Bull, Mr Rabbit, <r. Pony and Mr. Zabra.

Moo, is Daddy Pig coming out to play?

Come on!

Mummy, can we see the fire engine?

Yes!

This is Miss. Rabbit’s fire station.

Hello, Peppa and George. Come and see the fire engine.

Fire engine! 

There is ladder for climbing, a hose for squirting water, and a big bell to ring. Now, let’s go up to the tower and look for fires. 

Hello everyone.

Hello Peppa! Hello, George.

Oh, who’s for a nice cup of tea and a chat?

That sounds nice.

A telephone!

Peppa, that is the fire phone. It’s only to be used when thereis a fire.

Ah, fire! Fire! Fire station, where is the fire? Where is the fire?

Can I speak to Mummy pig, please?

Oh, it’s Daddy pig.

Daddy pig, you are not supposed to ring on this phone. It’s only for emergencies.

This is an emergency. I can’t find the tomato ketchup anywhere.

Daddy pig, shall I start to barbecue now?

Yes, please, Mr.Rabbit.

Do be careful with the barbecue, daddy pig.

Trust me, mummy pig. We daddies know all about barbecues. Bye!

Maybe it needs more charcoal.

Give it a bit of blow.

Put a few more fire lighters on.

Now, we just have to wait for a fire.

How long do we have to wait?

Oh, it could be a long time.

I’ve been waiting ages.

How many fires have you actually put out, Miss. Rabbit?

None, not one fire, but you’ve got to be ready.

It’s the fire phone.

Can you answer it, Peppa? It’ll probably be your daddy again.

OK. Hello, fire station. Hello, Peppa.

Oh, daddy, it is you! You’re very naughty. This phone is for fires only.

Can you put Miss. Rabbit, please? That’s a good girl!

Daddy wants to speak to you.

Hello, daddy pig. This phone is only to be used when there is a ...

Fire! Fire!

Oh, dear, daddy pig’s barbecue is on fire.

Fire! Fire! Mummy to the rescue!

Hold tight!

It’s Miss Rabbit fire engine.

Stand back, daddies. Mummy dog, turn on the water.

Aye, aye, mummy pig! 

The fire is out.

Thank you for saving us, Miss Rabbit.

I love fire engines, especially then they made muddy puddles!



# 11、The Library

It is bed time. 

Good night Peppa, good night George.

Can I have a story, please?

OK. I will read you the Red Monkey book.

But we alway have that one, the Red Monkey has a bath, cleans his teeth and goes proceed.

Eh... yes, that is what happens.

Can we do another story, the blue tiger, the green spider, the orange penguin, oh what’s this one?

The wonderful world of concrete.

I’ve been looking for that! 

Is it your book Daddy?

It’s a book I borrowed from the library.

What’s the library.

It’s a place you borrow books from and when you finish reading them, you take them back.

But daddy pig has forgotten to take this book back.

I have had it for rather a long time.

Never mind, you can take it back tomorrow, but now it’s bed time.

After Dad reads this story.

It’s not much of the story, Peppa.

Please read it, daddy.

OK. The wonderful world of concrete. Concrete is a construction material composed of sand, water and chemical admixtures. Chapter one, sand.

Peppa, George and Mommy Pig have fallen asleep. It is the morning,  Peppa and her family have come to the library.

Wow what’s a lot of book.

Peppa you must quiet in the library.

Why?

Because people come here to read and to be quiet.

Next please!

Miss rabbit is the librarion.

Hello Mummy Pig, are you returning these books?

Yes, Miss Rabbit.

Right you are.

Why is the computer beeping?

It’s checking to see that you haven’t been naughty in borrowing the book for too long.

I may have borrowed this book for a bot too long.

Don’t worry, Daddy Pig, it cannot be that bad. Gosh, Daddy Pig, you’ve had this book out for ten years!

Naughty daddy!

Sorry Miss rabbit.

That’s all right, now you can borrow another book.

Miss rabbit, can George and I borrow a book please?

Yes, the children section is over here.

Oh look, fairies, flowers, pretty dresses...

Hello Peppa, Hello Danny.

I am borrowing book about football.

Hello, Peppa! Hello Suzy!

I got a book about nursing.

George has chosen a book about dinosaurs.

Look what I’ve found, Further Adventures in the World of Concrate!

Here is a red monkey book. 

Not the red monkey book. It’s boring!

But this is a different story. It might be more fun.

I bet it’s not.

Once upon a time, there was a red monkey.

Oh, He had a bath, cleaed tis teeth and went to bed.

No, he jumoed into a space rocket and went to the moon. He had a picnic with the dinosaur, swam under the sea and climbed the highest mountain. That was  a busy day. The end.

Wow! Read it again.

We can borrow it and read it at home, Peppa.

But I was going to choose this book or this one.

You can take three books home if you want, Peppa. But you must remember to bring them back on time.   

Yes, Miss Rabbit.

And you must remember to bring your book back, too, Daddy pig.

I’ll make sure daddy remembers.

Yes Peppa. I’m sure you will.



# 12、Pollys Boat Trip

Geandpa pig is taking Peppa and George on a boat trip. Polly parrot is going too.

Grandpa pig, have you got your moblie phone?

Yes, granny pig.

Don’t drop it in the water.

No, granny pig.

Is it switched on?

Yes, granny pig.

Here is grandad dog.

Aha there. Granddad dog. Aha there. Lovely day to go sailing. I would go, too. But my boat needs to clean.

I don’t know why you bother cleaning that rusty boat. I’m surprise it’s still afloat.

This rusty boat will still be afloat long after you old tin boat has sunk to the bottom of the river.

Granddad dog is grandpa pig’s very best friend.

Boat steam ahead! Goodbye!

I am the captain of this boat,  and when the captain tells you to do something, you must do it.

Aye, aye, Captain!

Polly parrot copies everything that they said.

Geore, raise the flay. Peppa ring the bell.

Grandpa, can I be the captain, please?

OK. But as a captain,  you must wear this hat. Now Peppa is the captain, and everyone must do what she says.

Ring the bell. Turn that wheel. Aye aye, Captain Peppa.

Jump up and down. 

Captain Peppa is a bit bossy.

Perhaps I should be the captain again. We don’t want a crash into anything. Steering the boat can be tricky. Luckily, I’m good at steering.

Oh dear. Grandpa pig’s boat has crashed into a little island.

Grandpa, we’re stuck.

I’ll ring granny pig. She can get help.

Grandpa pig has dropped his phone in the water.

Granny pig speaking. Hello? Hello. Hello

Somehow, we need to get a message to granny.

Polly can fly to granny.

Good idea, Peppa! And I can teach Polly waht to say. Grandpa pig says,  Help, help! There you see easy peasy.

You silly old brid.

Hello, Polly. What are you doing here?

Grandpa pig say...

What does grandpa pig say?

You silly old brid. Help, help!

Goodness me, Grandpa must need help!

Granddad dog. Hello, granny pig.

Grandpa pig needs help. Please, could you rescue him?

Madam, I would be delighted.

Do you need rescuing, captain?

En, maybe.

Would you like my rusty old boat to rescue you?

Yes, please, granddad dog.

Catch this, captain. Aye aye, skippe.

Granddad dog is grandpa pig’s very best friend.

Granny, did Polly tell you we needed help?

Yes, Polly is very clever parrot.

Say I’m a clever parrot, woof woof!

I’m clever parrot.



# 13、Pedros Cough

It’s a school day. Peppa and her friends having a music lesson.

Miss Polly had a dolly. Sorry, Madame Gazelle.

Oh dear, Pedro has a cough.

Don’t worry. I’ll ring doctor Brown Bear.

Doctor Brown Bear, speaking. Hello dortor, this is Madame Gazelle. A child is ill.

Don’t panic. I’ll come straight away. What seems to be the problem? 

I’ve got a cough. I see. Is it a tickly cough or a chesty cough?

I don’t know, but it goes like this. And when did you get this cough?

When Madame Gazelle started singing. It’s nothing serious, but Pedro’s cough may be catching.

What do you mean “catching”?

When one person has a cough,  sometimes other people get that cough, too.

Do I need medicine? Just a little spoonful. I’m afraid it doesn’t taste very nice.

It tastes like an old shoe full of jam.

Thank you Doctor Browm Bear. Goodbye. Bye.

As I thought, Pedro’s cough is catching.

Danny Dog and Suzy Sheep have caught Pedro’s cough.

Open wide. It tastes of cuppet flavored yogurt. It tastes of flowers.

Well-done for taking your medicine so well.

Do you ever get ill, Doctor Brown Bear? No, Peppa. I’m ever ill.

I eat an apple a day. Goodbye. Bye.

It is home time, and the children’s parents are here to pick them up.

Mummy, daddy, I’ve got a cough.

Doctor Brown Bear came to look after us. He gave us horrible medicine.

Madame Gazelle, can you sing your song now? Of course, Peppa.

Miss Polly had a dolly who was...

Oh, dear, all the grown-ups have got Pedro’s cough.

Doctor Brown Bear speaking. This is Peppa pig. All the grown-ups are ill.

Not to worry, Peppa. I’m on my way.

Hello, everyone. Caught Pedro’s cough, have we?

Very well. Stand in a line and open wide.

It tastes like custard and old socks. Thank you for looking after us, Doctor Brown Bear.

Who looks after you when you’re ill? No one looks after me. I’m never ill.

Oh, dear. Doctor Brown Bear has caught Pedro’s cough.

Not to worry, goodbye. Goodbye.

Poor Doctor Brown Bear. He is ill and there is no one to look after him. Oh.

Who can that be? Hello, we’ve come to look after you.

Here is some fruit and some cushions. Here is your medicine.

It tasres like jammy-yogurt-flavored custard socks.

And here is a song to make you feel better.

That’s amazing. Here is your giant teddy. Would you like a little teddy instead, peppa?

No way who say. Look mummy. A giant teddy! It’s a bit big. No, it’s not.

Oh dear. It’s a bit to high for George. Don’t worry George. I will come up with you. That’s one pound, please.

Goerge isn’t afraid of height any more. Oh, it is a bit high, isn’t it? I’ll just go down the stairs.

The stairs are full of children.

That the way down, daddy pig. Oh, ok.

Roll up, roll up. Hit the target and win a giant teddy.

You can do that easy, mummy.

We do not want to win another giant teddy, peppa.

Five time’s round for one pound. Five time’s round? Oh, no.

Roll up, roll up. Test your strength on the old hammer and bell.

No skill involved, but you need to be strong. I’ll have a go. One pound. Bad luck.

Hoho, I’m strong. I’ll have a go. Srand back, everyong.

Do be careful, daddy pig. You are no that fit. Yes, daddy pig is loking a bit tubby.

What? I’m just saying daddy pig is a bit round in the tummy. Give me that hammer.

Goodness me. I’ve never seen anything like it. That wins the giant teddies we have.

Mummy, can we give these teddies to my friends?

What a good idea! Thank, Peppa. Most kind. Thank you very much.



# 15、Grandpa at the Playground

Grandpa  pig is looking after Peppa George today. Now Grandpa I will tell you how everything works.

This is the silde. You climb and you slide down there. And everyone takes it in turns.

I know what a slide is, Peppa. I used to play on one myself when I was a little piggy.

Did you have swings, too in the olden days. 

We had swings and climb frames and roundabouts. But my favorite was the slide.

It’s my favorite, too. 

Everyone takes it in turns to have a go on the slide.

Naughty Richard, you know you have to wait turn.

Richard rabbit finds it’s  hard to wait his turn.

Oh Dear, it’s not easy being  small, is it Richard? Because Richard is little, I don’t think you should have to wait.

I wouldn’t change the rules if I were you Grandpa Pig.

Nonsense, the children understand, don’t you? But Grandpa, George is little and he has to wait his turn.

Yes, George is little,  so he shouldn’t have to wait neither.

Oh, dear, Richard and George are taking all the turns on this slide.

Grandpa, when do we get go on the slide. Don’t worry, Peppa,  they won’t be on it for long.

I an bored of waiting. Me too! Let’s play on the swing. 

Here is Pedro Pony on the swing. Pedro, can I have a go now?

I just want to swing a bit more. But you have on the swing for ages.

Grandpa Pig, could you push me a little bit please?

I think it is someone else’s turn now, Pedro. But I have to go home soon.

Oh, I see!  That’s different. Let me push you then.

But, Grandpa.  I’m bored of waiting. Me too!  And me! Let’s play on the roundabout.

Everyone wants to get on the roundabout.

Too many children on the roundabout. Everybody off! 

But Grandpa pig, I was actually here first. Ah! Then you can get back on the roundabout.

I need to get on too. Why is that? Rebecca. Because it’s my birthday soon.Oh! Ok!

 And me. All right, is everybody ready?

Stop, there are on boys on the roundabout. Now is everybody ready?

I’m wearing glasses. Can I go on please?

The children themselves are making up their own rules.

I need to get on, because I like carrots. Now, are you all ready to go? No, I have to get on because I can do this.

 Here is mummy pig. How are you getting on grandpa pig?

 I’m confused. There playground rules are too complicated. There is only one rule grandpa pig, and that is, everyone waits their turn.

What? Even the little ones? Even the little ones.

What’s about the very old ones like grandpa?

Even the very old ones like grandpa.

At the playground everyone has their turn.

# 19、A Trip to the Moon

It’s  a lovely sunny day. Peppa is playing with her bouncy ball. George and his friend Edmond Elephant are playing with their space toys.

Moon, moon. George is pretending the bouncy ball is the  moon.

I was playing with that ball. Edmond’s space toy has landed on Peppa’s head.

This looks fun. Are you going to the moon? It’s just boring space stuff for bady study. It’s not real.

But space is real, Peppa. And there are real rockets that go to the moon.

And museum has a show all about the moon. Shall we go and see it?

Will we really have to go to the moon? No, Peppa, we are not going to the moon.

We are going to the museum. Ok

Here is the museum. 

Hello, everyone. Have you come to see the moon show? Yes, Miss Rabbit, five tickets, please.

There you are. Enjoy your trip to the moon.

Ooh, we really are going to the moon. No, Peppa, it’s just pretend.

This way for our trip to the moon. Mr. Rabbit is the tour guide. Prepare, take off.

It is just pretend, isn’t?

That’s right, Peppa. It’s just pretend. Five, four, three, two, one, blast off!

We live on a planet. Does anyone know what it is called? The Earth. That’s right.

I am a bit of expert at the space things. There’re seven other planets that go around our sun.

Does anyone know what they are call? Mercury. Oh, well done, Edmond. Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus. Edmond knows all about the space. I am clever clout.

Does anyone know what there planets are made of? They ar made of cardboard.

These models are made of cardboard. But the real planets are made of rock and ice and gas.

But of course the moon is made of cheese.

No, the moon is made of rock, and this is a serious tour. So no jokes and no giggling.

Here we are , on the moon. It’s pretend moon, really, isn’t

Yes, if this was the real moon, you could jump over my head. Does anyone know why we can jump so high on the moon? Gravity.

Oh, that’s right, Edmond. Gravity is what keeps us on the grounp. It’s weaker on the moon, so you can jump higher. We can make you feel like you are jumping on the moon. With a hep of science.

That sounds impressive. With big rubber bands.

Everyone is scrapping into  Mr. Rabbit anti-Gravity rubber bands.

Bouncing on the pretend moon is fun. Say moon cheese. Moon cheese.

And that’s the end of the tour. Please walk this way. Are there trees on the moon? No.

Are there any castles on the moon? No. Are there any moon shops? No.

That would be silly. Welcome to the moon shop. We’ve got moon maps, moon books.

We’ve even got a picture of piggies on the moon with an elephant.

Look there we are, jumping on the moon. We’ve got moon rock, too. It got a picture of the moon all the way through the middle. How about some real moon cheese?

How much is it. Miss Rabbit? Five pounds, please. It’s all for good cause. I like the moon now because it’s very interesting. Mmm, and very tasty



# 20、Princess Peppa

It’s bed time for Peppa and George. Goodnight, my little piggies!

Grandy and Grandpa pig have come for dinner. Hello Where are Peppa and George?

They are asleep. Oh, but I so want to see them, can I take a peek?

Ok, granny pig, but be very quiet. Granny pig! Hello, my little darlings! You should be asleep!

Tell us a story! Ok, but only if you promise to go straight back to sleep.

Ok, I’ll just sleep after the story. All right. Once upon a time, there was...

A little boy called Pedro Pony, and he found some magic bean. Oh! Yes. Now Pedro planted the bean And it grew into an enormous bean stalk that went high into the sky. That’s right!

Mummy pig, daddy pig and grandpa pig are waiting to eat dinner.

I’ll go and see what’s keeping granny pig. What’s next in the story?

Naughty Granny pig!  You woke the little ones. We promised to sleep when the story ends, Grandpa.

I’m good at ending stories, Granny pig. And you go down stairs. I won’t be long.

There’s a boy, a bean stalk, a beautiful princess, a brave knight. and a cook who makes the lovely dinner.

Well, after they ate the lovely dinner,  everyone fell asleep, the end. Then they all woke up and along came a wizard. A wizard? Yes, a wizard who was going to do a big magic show. Ah, but. Then, along caome a scary dragon. 

Granny pig, Mummy Pig and Daddy pig are still waiting to eat dinner.

That bit time story doesn’t seem to be working. I’m the expert in telling bentime stories, I’ll have them sleeping in no time. Ahhh, a scary dragon!

Peppa, Geroge, back to bed! But grandpa hasn’t finished the story yet, Daddy.

I’ll finish the story. I’ll be done in a minute. 

Ok, there is a boy, a bean stalk, a castle, a beautiful princess, a brave knight, a cook, a wizard and a scary dragon. And a very hungry king.

So they all had a big dinner and lived happily ever after. Then end.

Then, they had a party! And all their friends came.

Right, I think I’d better sort this out.

Daddy pig! They are almost asleep. Thank you. I’ll take over  now. You have to finish the story, mummy.

Ok, quickly now. Tell me what’s happened.

Once upon the time, i olden days, a long time ago... Mummy pig has been up there for a long time.

I can hear snoring. At last! Peppa and George are asleep.

Then they all lived happily ever after. The end.

Peppa, George! Shi--Mummy is asleep!

Hohohoh, it looks like princess Peppa is the best to tell the bedtime stories.

That’s right. I am!

# 22、Talent Day

It’s the end of anohter day at Peppa’s play group.

Children, tomorrow is Talent Day. What’s  a talent? A talent is some thing you like doing and you are good at.

I like to watch television and I am good at it.

Think of something we might like to see you do. My talent is playing the guitar.

The parents have arrived to pick up the children.

Don’t forget to think of something to do for Talent Day tomorrow.

It’s bedtime for Peppa and George. I can’t go to bed yet. I haven’t  got a talent to show tomorrow.

But you have lots of talents, Peppa. Yes, I can skip. I can sing. Twinkle twinkle, little star. I can dance. It’s hard to choose one talent. I am good at lot of things.

Don’t worry, you can decide tomorrow. Ok

It’s Talent Day. My talents are skipping, singing and dancing. I practiced them all last night.

I was practicing watching television last night. That’ not a talent. Madame Gazelle said so.

What can I do then? Who would like to show us their talent first.

Danny Dog. I can bang a drum. I can bang it louder. No, that was lovely, Danny.

Pedro Pony, what’s your talent? Magic Tricks. Here’s a glass of water. It’s wet and see-through.

Now I will make the water disappear. Please close your eyes. Open your eyes. \

The water has gone. Thank you.

Emily Elephant, I am going to play the recorder.

And what is your talent, Rebecca? I can make a special noise. It only works if I gulp on my tiptoes.

That was the hiccup. Yes, but what can I do?

Candy, what is your talent? skipping.

I was going to do skipping. But I can still do dancing and singing.

My talent is singing. Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

I can still do dancing. 

Suzy Sheep, what is your talent?  Dancing.

No. you can’t dance...

Oh, dear, dancing was Peppa’s last talent.

It’s so nice that everyone has chosen a different talent to perform. Now, what do we have left, Peppa.

 I was going to skip, or sing, or dance! But they have all been done.

A talent can be anything, Peppa. But not watching television.

Think of something you really like to do.

I know! I’ve got a talent that’s I’m really good at.

I wonder what Peppa’s talent could be.

My special talent that’s the best dance in the whole world, is jumping up and down in muddy puddle!

Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.

Everyone loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles.
